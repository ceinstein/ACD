NOT BUG:Collect the names of generated files and clean them away at target clean:
BUG:Add $LIB_CFLAGS for any buildinfo generator that uses $CFLAGSThe reason to do so is that some of the generators detect PIC flagslike fPIC and KPIC, and those are normally delivered in LD_CFLAGS
NOT BUG:Use single quotes rather than double quotes when neededWhen passing down values to Makefileshared, do so with single quotesas much as possible to avoid having the shell create a mess of quotes
NOT BUG:Harmonize Unix Makefile template with Windows ditoThe variable SHARED_CFLAGS and SHARD_LDFLAGS were used in the Unixtemplate because they normally contain options used when building"shared"  The Windows template, on the other hand, uses LIB_CFLAGS,to express the intended use of those flags rather than their contentThe Windows template still used SHARED_LDFLAGS, which seemsinconsistentTo harmonize the two, any SHARED_CFLAGS gets renamed to LIB_CFLAGS andSHARED_LDFLAGS to LIB_LDFLAGS  That makes the intent consistent alongwith BIN_{C,LD}FLAGS and DSO_{C,LD}FLAGSFinally, make sure to pass down $LIB_CFLAGS or $DSO_CFLAGS alongwith $CFLAGS when using Makefileshared
NOT BUG:Fix memory leak in library deinitENGINE_cleanup calls CRYPTO_free_ex_data and therefore,CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data  which cleans up the method pointers  mustrun after ENGINE_cleanupAdditionally, don't needlessly initialize the EX_CALLBACKS stack duringeg CRYPTO_free_ex_data The only time this is actually needed is whenreserving the first ex data index Specifically, since sk_num returns 1on NULL input, the rest of the code already handles a NULL method stackcorrectly

NOT BUG:Don't build dynamic engines unless configured "shared"Experience has shown that dynamic engines with their own copy oflibcrypto is problematic, so we disable that possibility
NOT BUG:Harmonise the two methods to generate dependency filesOne of them didn't clean away dtmp files properlyThe other would overwrite the d files unconditionally, therebycausing a possibly unnecessary dependency rebuild, which touches thedate of Makefile, which causes a possibly unnecessary rebuild ofbuildinfh and everything that depends on that
NOT BUG:More tweaks to the installation instructionsA few things were out of date and a few things were missing Also someformatting updates
NOT BUG:Fix some assembler generating scripts for better unificationSome of these scripts would recognise an output parameter if it lookslike a file path  That works both in both the classic and new buildschemes  Some fo these scripts would only recognise it if it's abasename ie no directory component  Those need to be corrected,as the output parameter in the new build scheme is more likely tocontain a directory component than not

NOT BUG:Add an entry in NEWS about the new threading API
NOT BUG:Update CHANGES for the new threading API
NOT BUG:Remove the old threading APIAll OpenSSL code has now been transferred to use the new threading API,so the old one is no longer used and can be removed We provide some compatmacros for removed functions which are all noopsThere is now no longer a need to set locking callbacks!!
NOT BUG:Remove use of the old CRYPTO_LOCK_X5O9_STOREThe locking here is a bit strange and unclear Rather than refactoranything and possibly break stuff I have just moved to using the newthread API following as closely as possible what was there previously

NOT BUG:Fix memory leak in ssltestThe new Rand usage of Thread API exposed a bug in ssltest ssltest "cheats"and uses internal headers to directly call functions that normally youwouldn't be able to do This means that autoinit doesn't happen, andtherefore autodeinit doesn't happen either, meaning that the new rand locksdon't get cleaned up properly
NOT BUG:Convert rand code to new threading APIReplace the CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND and CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND2 locks with new threadAPI style locks
NOT BUG:Adapt unix Makefile template to 'nomakedepend'This change is a bit more complex, as it involves several recipevariantsAlso, remove the $CROSS_COMPILE prefix for the makedepend programWhen we use the program "makedepend", this doesn't serve anything,and when we use the compiler, this value isn't even used
NOT BUG:Adapt descripmmstmpl to 'nomakedepend'VMS doesn't have "makedepend" anyway, so this is just a matter of usingthe right qualifiers when 'makedepend' is enabled

NOT BUG:Make mk1mf recognise the classic flag
NOT BUG:Fix configurations such as 'dist' and tar buildingFor config targets such as 'dist', which doesn't have a BASE template,we still need to have a default build schemeAdditionally, the unified Makefile template's target 'tar' wasn'tquite as flexible as the unixmake oneFinally, traviscreatereleasesh can be somewhat simplified now thatit builds with the unified build scheme

NOT BUG:Refactor dasync cipher implementations to improve code reuseMove out most of the boiler plate code that is common between aes128cbcand aes128cbchmacsha1 into helper functions to improve code reuse
NOT BUG:Move the _hidden_ static variables in dasync to be constructed in bindThe _hidden_ variables were being created onthefly It is better tocreate them once up front during bind to avoid any potential raceconditions
NOT BUG:Fix typo in SSL_pending docs
NOT BUG:Rename EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cipher_data to EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_cipher_dataWe had the function EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cipher_data which is newly added for110 As we now also need an EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_cipher_data it makesmore sense for the former to be called EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_cipher_data
NOT BUG:Fix s_server/s_client handling of the split_send_frag argumentEnsure that a value of 0 is correctly handled for the split_send_fragargument
NOT BUG:Add documentation for the EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cipher_data functionsThe new pipeline code added a new functionEVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_cipher_data Add documentation for this and theexisting EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cipher_data function
NOT BUG:Remove the wrec record layer fieldWe used to use the wrec field in the record layer for keeping track of thecurrent record that we are writing out As part of the pipelining changesthis has been moved to stack allocated variables to do the same thing,therefore the field is no longer needed
NOT BUG:Update a commentUpdate a comment that was out of date due to the pipelining changes
NOT BUG:Add documentation for new s_server/s_client optionsDocument the new split_send_frag, max_pipelines and read_buf options
NOT BUG:Add documentation for SSL_has_pendingA previous commit added the SSL_has_pending function which provides amethod for knowing whether OpenSSL has buffered, but as yet unprocessedrecord data
NOT BUG:Add pipelining documentationAdd some documentation for all of the SSL/SSL_CTX functions/ctrls forconrolling read and write pipelining
NOT BUG:Fix erroneous fall thgrough in switch statementFix an erroenous fall through when setting the max_pipelines value
NOT BUG:Ensure s_client and s_server work when read_ahead is setPreviously s_client and s_server relied on using SSL_pending which doesnot take into account read_ahead For read pipelining to work, read_aheadgets set automatically Therefore s_client and s_server have beenconverted to use SSL_has_pending instead
NOT BUG:Add an SSL_has_pending functionThis is similar to SSL_pending but just returns a 1 if there is datapending in the internal OpenSSL buffers or 0 otherwise as opposed toSSL_pending which returns the number of bytes available UnlikeSSL_pending this will work even if "read_ahead" is set which is thecase if you are using read pipelining, or if you are doing DTLS A 1return value means that we have unprocessed data It does not necessarilyindicate that there will be application data returned from a call toSSL_read The unprocessed data may not be application data or therecould be errors when we attempt to parse the records
NOT BUG:Add an ability to set the SSL read buffer sizeThis capability is required for read pipelining We will only read in asmany records as will fit in the read buffer and the network can providein one go The bigger the buffer the more records we can process inparallel
NOT BUG:Lazily initialise the compression bufferWith read pipelining we use multiple SSL3_RECORD structures for readingThere are SSL_MAX_PIPELINES 32 of them defined typically not all of thesewould be used Each one has a 16k compression buffer allocated! Thisresults in a significant amount of memory being consumed which, most of thetime, is not needed  This change swaps the allocation of the compressionbuffer to be lazy so that it is only done immediately before it is actuallyused
NOT BUG:Implement read pipeline support in libsslRead pipelining is controlled in a slightly different way than with writepipelining While reading we are constrained by the number of records thatthe peer and the network can provide to us in one go The more recordswe can get in one go the more opportunity we have to parallelise theprocessingThere are two parameters that affect this: The number of pipelines that we are willing to process in one go This iscontrolled by max_pipelines as for write pipelining The size of our read buffer A subsequent commit will provide an API foradjusting the size of the bufferAnother requirement for this to work is that "read_ahead" must be set Theread_ahead parameter will attempt to read as much data into our read bufferas the network can provide Without this set, data is read into the readbuffer on demand Setting the max_pipelines parameter to a value greaterthan 1 will automatically also turn read_ahead onFinally, the read pipelining as currently implemented will only parallelisethe processing of application data records This would only make adifference for renegotiation so is unlikely to have a significant impact
NOT BUG:Add dummy pipeline support for aes128_cbc_hmac_sha1Add dummy pipline support to dasync for the aes128_cbc_hmac_sha1 cipherThis is treated as an AEAD cipher
NOT BUG:Add pipeline support to s_server and s_clientAdd the options min_send_frag and max_pipelines to s_server and s_clientin order to control pipelining capabilities This will only have an effectif a pipeline capable cipher is used such as the one provided by thedasync engine
NOT BUG:Implement write pipeline support in libsslUse the new pipeline cipher capability to encrypt multiple records beingwritten out all in one go Two new SSL/SSL_CTX parameters can be used tocontrol how this works: max_pipelines and split_send_fragmentmax_pipelines defines the maximum number of pipelines that can ever be usedin one go for a single connection It must always be less than or equal toSSL_MAX_PIPELINES currently defined to be 32 By default only onepipeline will be used ie normal nonparallel operationsplit_send_fragment defines how data is split up into pipelines The numberof pipelines used will be determined by the amount of data provided to theSSL_write call divided by split_send_fragment For example ifsplit_send_fragment is set to 2000 and max_pipelines is 4 then:SSL_write called with 02000 bytes  1 pipeline usedSSL_write called with 20014000 bytes  2 pipelines usedSSL_write called with 40016000 bytes  3 pipelines usedSSL_write_called with 6001+ bytes  4 pipelines usedsplit_send_fragment must always be less than or equal to max_send_fragmentBy default it is set to be equal to max_send_fragment This will mean thatthe same number of records will always be created as would have beencreated in the nonparallel case, although the data will be apportioneddifferently In the parallel case data will be spread equally between thepipelines
NOT BUG:Update the dasync engine to add a pipeline cipherImplement aes128cbc as a pipeline capable cipher in the dasync engineAs dasync is just a dummy engine, it actually just performs the parallelencrypts/decrypts in serial
NOT BUG:Add defines for pipeline capable ciphersAdd a flag to indicate that a cipher is capable of performing"pipelining", ie multiple encrypts/decrypts in parallel Also add somenew ctrls that ciphers will need to implement if they are pipeline capable

NOT BUG:Add support for async jobs in OpenSSL speedSummary of the changes: Move the calls to the crypto operations inside wrapper functionsThis is required because ASYNC_start_job takes a function as an argument Add new function run_benchmark that manages the jobs for all the operationsIn the POSIX case it uses a select to receive the events from the engineand resume the jobs that are paused, while in the WIN case it uses PeekNamedPipe Add new option argument async_jobs to enable and specify the number of async jobsExample:openssl speed engine dasync elapsed async_jobs 32 rsa2048

NOT BUG:GH616: Remove dead codeSignedoffby: Rich Salz <rsalz@opensslorg>
NOT BUG:No fnocommon for DarwinWhen object files with common block symbols are added to staticlibraries on Darwin, those symbols are invisible to the linker thattries to use them  Our solution was to use fnocommon when compilingC sourceUnfortunately, there is assembler code that defines OPENSSL_ia32cap_Pas a common block symbol, unconditionally, and in some cases, there isno other definition  fnocommon doesn't help in this caseHowever, 'ranlib c' adds common block symbols to the index of thestatic library, which makes them visible to the linker using it, andthat solves the problem we've seenThe common conclusion is, either use fnocommon or ranlib c onDarwin  Since we have common block symbols unconditionally, choosingthe method for our source is easy

NOT BUG:Document the changes in config settings
NOT BUG:Don't copy from target to config so much, see config as a complementWe copied $target{cflags}, $target{defines} and a few more to config,just to add to the entries  Avoid doing so, and let the build templatesdeal with combining the twoThere are a few cases where we still fiddle with target, but that'sacceptable
NOT BUG:Configure  Get rid of the special thread_cflag, replace with thread_schemeThe thread_cflag setting filled a double role, as kinda sorta anindicator of thread scheme, and as cflags  Some configs also addedlflags and ex_libs for multithreading regardless of if threading wouldbe enabled or notInstead of this, add threading cflags among in the cflag setting,threading lflags in the lflag setting and so on if and only if threadsare enabled which they are by defaultAlso, for configs where there are no special cflags for threading theVMS configs are of that kind, this makes it possible to still clearlymention what thread scheme is usedThe exact value of thread scheme is currently ignored except when it's"unknown", and thereby only serves as a flag to tell if we know howto build for multithreading in a particular config  Yet, thecurrently used values are "unknown", "pthreads", "uithreads" akasolaris threads and "winthreads"
NOT BUG:Configure  get rid of the special debug_ and release_ settingsInstead, make the build type "debug" or "release" available through$config{build_type} and let the configs themselves figure out what theusual settings such as "cflags", "lflags" and so on should beaccordinglyThe benefit with this is that we can now have debug and releasevariants of any setting, not just those Configure supports, and mayalso involve other factors the MSVC flags /MD[d] and /MT[d] involveboth build type and whether threading is enabled or not
NOT BUG:Minimize copied config settings$target{lflags} and $target{plib_flag} were copied to config for nogood reason
NOT BUG:Configure  move the addition of the zlib / libz lib to configsConfigure had the Unix centric addition of lz when linking with zlibis enabled, which doesn't work on other platforms  Therefore, we moveit to the BASE_unix config template and add corresponding ones in theother BASE_ config templates  The Windows one is probably incomplete,but that doesn't matter for the moment, as mk1mf does it's own thinganywayThis required making the withargs table global, so perl snippets inthe configs can use it
NOT BUG:Configure  Rename BASE to DEFAULTS and add a few inheritable BASEsThese BASE templates are intended to hold values that are common forall configuration variants for whole families of configurationsSo far, three "families" are identified: Unix, Windows and VMS, mostlycharacterised by the build system they currently use
NOT BUG:Configure  Allow CODErefs and ARRAYrefs in configuration setting arraysThis provides for more powerful lazy evaluation and buildup of thesetting contents  For example, something like this becomes possible:defines > [ sub { $config{thisorthat} ? "FOO" :  } ]Any undefined result of such functions such as 'undef' or the emptylist will be ignored

NOT BUG:Refactor the async wait fd logicImplementation experience has shown that the original plan for async waitfds was too simplistic Originally the async logic created a pipe internallyand user/engine code could then get access to it via API calls It is moreflexible if the engine is able to create its own fd and provide it to theasync codeAnother issue is that there can be a lot of churn in the fd value withinthe context of say a single SSL connection leading to continually addingand removing fds from say epoll It is better if we can provide somestability of the fd value across a whole SSL connection This isproblematic because an engine has no concept of an SSL connectionThis commit refactors things to introduce an ASYNC_WAIT_CTX which acts as aproxy for an SSL connection down at the engine layer

BUG:Add a "nopic" build for Travis
NOT BUG:Rewrite CHANGES to add some commentary about the "pic" option
NOT BUG:Introduce the "pic" / "nopic" config optionBuilding shared libraries or not is not the same as building positionindependent code or not  It's true that if you don't build PIC, youcan't build shared libraries  However, you may very well want tobuild only static libraries but still want PIC codeTherefore, we introduce a new configuration option "pic", which isenabled by default or explicitely with "enablepic", or disabled with"nopic" or "disablepic"  Of course, if "pic" is disabled, "shared"and "dynamicengine" are automatically disabled as well

NOT BUG:Unified on VMS  install dynamic engines if there are anyDon't check for no_shared
NOT BUG:Run the TLSProxy based tests as long as dynamic engines are builtThey depend on this feature because they use the engine ossltest,which is only available as a dynamic engine
NOT BUG:Build dynamic engines even if configured "noshared"Until now, the engines in engines/ were only built as dynamicalyloadable ones if shared libraries were builtWe not dissociate the two and can build dynamicaly loadable engineseven if we only build static libcrypto and libssl  This is controlledwith the option enable|disable|nostaticengine, defaulting tonostaticengineNote that the engines in crypto/engine/ dynamic and cryptodev willalways be built into libcrypto
NOT BUG:Always build library object files with shared library cflagsThis takes us away from the idea that we know exactly how our staticlibraries are going to get used  Instead, we make them available tobuild shareable things with, be it other shared libraries or DSOsOn the other hand, we also have greater control of when the sharedlibrary cflags  They will never be used with object files meant gotbinaries, such as apps/openssl or test/testWith unified, we take this a bit further and prepare for having todeal with extra cflags specifically to be used with DSOs dynamicengines, libraries and binaries applications

NOT BUG:Big rename fest of MingW shared librariesSo far, MingW shared libraries were named like thislibeay32dll + libeay32dllassleay32dll + ssleay32dllaThat naming scheme is antiquated, a reminicense of SSLeay  We'retherefore changing the scheme to something that's more like the restof OpenSSLThere are two factors to remember: Windows libraries have no recorded SOvers, which means that theshared library version must be encoded in the name  According tosome, it's unwise to encode extra periods in a Windows file name,so we convert version number periods to underscores MingW has multilib ability  However, DLLs need to reside with thebinaries that use them, so to allow both 32bit and 64bit DLLs toreside in the same place, we add 'x64' in the name of the 64bitonesThe resulting name scheme for SOver 11 is this:on x86:libcrypto1_1dll + libcryptodllalibssl1_1dll + libssldllaon x86_64:libcrypto1_1x64dll + libcryptodllalibssl1_1x64dll + libssldllaAn observation is that the import lib is the same for botharchitectures  Not to worry, though, as they will be installed inPREFIX/lib/ for x86 and PREFIX/lib64/ for x86_64As a side effect, MingW got its own targets in Makefilesharedlink_dsomingwshared and link_appmingwshared are aliases for thecorresponding cygwinshared targets  link_shlibmingwshared is,however, a target separated from the cygwin one
NOT BUG:Misc small fixesBetter libclean that removes the exact files that have been built,nothing more and nothing lessCorrected typoA couple of editorial changes
BUG:Try removing installation directories after having uninstalled filesOf course, if there are remaining files in a directory, it won't be removed
NOT BUG:Small rename fest in unified, obj2dynlib > obj2dsoSince we're using the acronym DSO everywhere else and that's a commonname for that kind of object, we might as well do so here as well
NOT BUG:Remake the installation of shared libraries in unixMakefiletmplInstead of having the installation recipe rely on special knowledge,feed it with information, including what shared library files belongtogether  For Cygwin and Mingw, that's the dll and its importlibrary dlla  For Unixen, it's the shared library file name with SOversion and the one without
NOT BUG:Big rename fest of engine DSO names, from libFOOso to FOOsoThe engine DSOs were named as if they were shared libraries, and couldend up having all sorts of fancy names:Cygwin: cygFOOdllMingw:  FOOeay32dllUnix:   libFOOso / libFOOsl / libFOOdylib / This may be confusing, since they look like libraries one should linkwith at link time, when they're just DSOsIt's therefore time to rename them, and do it consistently on allplatforms:Cygwin & Mingw: FOOdllUnix:           FOO{so,sl,dylib,}Interestingly enough, the MSVC and VMS builds always did it this way
NOT BUG:Simplify the generation of ld scripts for Linux and SolarisBecause we know for certain that the link_shlib targets are usedexclusively for shared libraries libcrypto and libssl and that theymust have an associated num file, we don't need to check the libraryname to produce an ld script  Just do it unconditionallylink_shliblinuxshared can be simplified further, as most of it isexactly the same as $DO_GNU_SO with just one variable modification
NOT BUG:Big rename fest in makefileshared: link_a / link_o > link_shlib / link_dsoOriginally, the Makefileshared targets described what they used asinput for a shared object, be it a shared library or a DSO  It turnedout, however, that the link_o targets were used exclusively forengines and the link_a targets were for libcrypto and libsslThis rename fest turns and indication on the kind of input the targetsget to the intention with using them
NOT BUG:Centralise the shared library / dso name info in unixMakefiletmpl
NOT BUG:Let Configure figure out the diverse shared library and DSO extensionsThen it can pass around the information where it belongs  TheMakefile templates pick it up along with other target data, theDSO module gets to pick up the information throughcrypto/include/internal/dso_confh
NOT BUG:VMS fixed in unified build install_sw had a display of text that belongs under the install target previous layout installed architecture dependent files indev:['prefix''arch'LIB], dev:['prefix''arch'EXE] anddev:['prefix''arch'ENGINES]  Changed to dev:['prefix'LIB'arch'],dev:['prefix'EXE'arch'] and dev:['prefix'ENGINES'arch'] instead
NOT BUG:Unified  don't install the ossltest engineThis is done with a simple file name comparison  We could think ofsomething more elegant in the future
NOT BUG:Unified  do a better job when uninstallingSome directories weren't removed
NOT BUG:Rethink the uplink / applink storyAdding uplink and applink to some builds was done by "magic", theconfiguration for "mingw" only had a macro definition, the Configurewould react to its presence by adding the uplink source files tocpuid_asm_src, and crypto/buildinfo inherited dance to get itcompiled, and Makefileshared made sure applinko would beappropriately linked in  That was a lot under the hoodTo replace this, we create a few template configurations inConfigurations/00basetemplatesconf, inherit one of them in the"mingw" configuration, the rest is just about refering to the$target{apps_aux_src} / $target{apps_obj} in the right places
NOT BUG:VMS: rather use a quick file comparison than DIFFVMS DIFF tries to calculate all the differences, which is slower thanjust reading the files and stopping at the first difference  Thelatter doesn't exist as a command, so the problem is solved with perland File::Compare has been in core perl since very early version 5
NOT BUG:VMS: produce dependency files just like you produce object filesWe need to do the same dance as when object files are created
NOT BUG:Fix casing on VMSDCL may be in extended parsing style, which makes it less caseinsensitive, so when removing a string from another, make sure to getcasing correctly
NOT BUG:Don't use configtimestamp, we already have configdatapmThe benefit with using configdatapm is that Configure writes it forus
NOT BUG:Automatic 'make depend' for the unified build schemeThis isn't the fully featured combination of compiler generateddependency files and Makefile include directives, but a cheapervariant of the sameThe dependency files are generated automatically, but then we have theusual "depend" target  However, we depend on it in the bigger phonytargets that are the most likely to be used  That make this featureautomatic enoughA side effect is that we can't use the build file's timestamp to checkif reconfiguring might be in order  In its place, we use a flag filethat depends on Configure and the build file template and depend on itin spots where it makes sense to check for the need to reconfigure
NOT BUG:Fix uninstall_sw for the unixmake schemeThe uninstall_sw target tried to 'make uninstall' in all subdirsChange it to only go into $INSTALL_SUBS, just like install_sw does
NOT BUG:Set EXE_EXT environment variable when testingWhen cross compiling, we may end up with someting like apps/opensslexeand a number of test/exe  However, util/shlib_wrapsh doesn't knowwhat the executable extension should be, if any, so we need to makesure it has access to that information when testing, sinceOpenSSL::Test uses that script to execute all programs
NOT BUG:Remove all special make depend flags, as well as OPENSSL_DOING_MAKEDEPENDAll those flags existed because we had all the dependencies versionedin the repository, and wanted to have it be consistent, no matter whatthe local configuration was  Now that the dependencies are gone fromthe versioned Makefileins, it makes much more sense to use the exactsame flags as when compiling the object files
NOT BUG:Don't treat d depend files separately from object filesd MMS in the VMS world files with just dependencies are built fromexactly the same conditions as the object files  Therefore, the rulesfor them can be built at the same time as the rules for thecorresponding object filesThis removes the requirement for a src2dep function in the build filetemplates, and for commontmpl to call it  In the end, the existenceof depend files is entirely up to the build file

NOT BUG:Make sure to use unsigned char for is functionsOn some platforms, the implementation is such that a signed chartriggers a warning when used with is functions  On others, thebehavior is outright buggy when presented with a char that happensto get promoted to a negative integerThe safest thing is to cast the char that's used to an unsigned char

NOT BUG:GH650: Minor tidying around the ocsp appThe ocsp utility is something of a jackofalltrades; most anythingrelated to the OCSP can be done with it  In particular, the manualpage calls out that it can be used as either a client or a serverof the protocol, but there are also a few things that it can dowhich do not quite fit into either role, such as encoding an OCSPrequest but not sending it, printing out a text form of an OCSPresponse or request from a file akin to the asn1parse utility,or performing a lookup into the serverside revocation databasewithout actually sending a request or response  All three of theseare documented as examples in the manual page, but the documentationprior to this commit is somewhat misleading, in that when printingthe text form of an OCSP response, the code also attempts toverify the response, displaying an error message and returningfailure if the response does not verify  It is possible thatthe response would be able to verify with the given example, sincethe default trust roots are used for that verification, but OCSPresponses frequently have alternate certification authoritiesthat would require passing CAfile or CApath for verificationTidy up the documentation by passing noverify for the case ofconverting from binary to textual representation, and alsochange a few instances of respin to reqin as appropriate, notethat the url option provides the same functionality as the hostand path options, clarify that the example that saves an OCSPresponse to a file will also perform verification on that response,and fix a couple grammar nits in the manual pageAlso remove an alwaystrue conditional for rdb !

NOT BUG:Let all TLSProxy based tests display debug text conditionallyIf the environment variable HARNESS_ACTIVE isn't defined orHARNESS_VERBOSE is defined, it's probable that lots of output isdesired
NOT BUG:Rethink logging of test recipesThe logging that was performed in OpenSSL::Test was initially set upas a means not to let messages that test programs write to STDERR getdisplayed when a test isn't running in verbose mode  However, the wayit was implemented, it meant that those messages were never displayed,and you had to look in a test log  This also meant that output toSTDERR and output to STDOUT got broken apart, which isn't optimalSo, we remove the whole test log file implementation, and instead,we're sending STDERR to the null device unless one of these conditionsapply: the test recipe already redirects stderr  Just let it the environment variable HARNESS_ACTIVE is undefined, meaning therecipe is run directly as a perl script instead of being harnessedby Test::Harness the environment variable HARNESS_VERBOSE is setGetting a full log of the tests now becomes as simple as this:HARNESS_VERBOSEyes make test 2>&1 | tee testslog
NOT BUG:Better workaround for VMS getnameinfo bugThe actual bug with current getnameinfo on VMS is not that it putsgibberish in the service buffer, but that it doesn't touch it at allThe gibberish we dealt with before was simply stuff that happened tobe on the stackIt's better to initialise the service buffer properly with the emptystring and check if it's still an empty string after thegetnameinfo call, and fill it with the direct numerical translationof the raw port if that's the case

NOT BUG:Typo: only return error if unrecognise bag type
NOT BUG:State the minimum Perl version that our scripts will work with
NOT BUG:Perl's chop / chomp considered bad, use a regexp insteadOnce upon a time, there was chop, which somply chopped off the lastcharacter of $_ or a given variable, and it was used to take off theEOL character \n of strings but then, you had to check for the presence of such characterSo came chomp, the better chop which checks for \n before chopping itoff  And this worked well, as long as Perl made internally sure thatall EOLs were converted to \nThese days, though, there seems to be a mixture of perls, so linesfrom files in the "wrong" environment might have \r\n as EOL, or just\r Mac OS, unless I'm misinformedSo it's time we went for the more generic variant and use s|\R$||, thebetter chomp which recognises all kinds of known EOLs and chops themoffA few chops were left alone, as they are use as surgical tools toremove one last slash or one last commaNOTE: \R came with perl 5100  It means that from now on, ourscripts will fail with any older version

NOT BUG:unified build system: add CHANGES & NEWS
NOT BUG:unified build scheme: rewrite INSTALLVMSThere is more to be added, but this will at least tell people how to try
NOT BUG:clean away old VMS cruftThe old building scripts get removed, they are hopelessly gone in bitrot by nowAlso remove the old symbol hacks  They were needed needed to shortensome names to 31 characters, and to resolve other symbol clashesBecause we now compile with /NAMESAS_IS,SHORTENED, this is nolonger required
NOT BUG:unified build scheme: add a "unified" template for VMS descripmmsAs part of this, change util/mkdefpl to stop adding libraries todepend on in its output  mkdefpl should ONLY output a symbolvectorBecause symbol names can't be longer than 31 characters, we use thecompiler to shorten those that are longer down to 23 characters plusan 8 character CRC  To make sure users of our header files will pickup on that automatically, add the DEC C supported extra headers files__decc_include_prologueh and __decc_include_epiloguehFurthermore, we add a configcom, so VMS people can configure just ascomfortably as any Unix folks, thusly:@config
NOT BUG:unified build scheme: add instructions for travis to build with unified
NOT BUG:unified build scheme: Try to nudge users to try the "unified" buildThis commit SHALL be reverted before final release
NOT BUG:unified build scheme: add the tweaks to build on Cygwin & MingwCygwin and Mingw name their libraries a bit differently from the restof the POSIXly universe, we need to adapt to thatIn Makefiletmpl, it means that some hunks will only be outputconditionallyThis also means that shared_extension for the Cygwin and Mingwconfigurations in Configurations/10mainconf are changing from dllato dll  Makefileshared does a fine job without having themspecified, and it's much easier to work with tucking an extra a atthe end of files in the installation recipes than any amount of namerewrites, especially with the support of the SHARED_NAME in the topbuildinfo
NOT BUG:unified build scheme: add a "unified" template for Unix MakefileThis also adds all the raw sections needed for some files
NOT BUG:unified build scheme: give util/dofilepl the possibility to output selectivelyUnder certain conditions, one might not want to output certainsections of a template file  This adds the functions output_off andoutput_on, reachable inside the templates  And example usage in aMakefile template could be this:@ : { output_off if $config{no_shared}; "" } lines dealing with shared libraries@ : { output_on }
NOT BUG:Configure et al: move the installation directory logic to MakefilesThe logic to figure out the combinations of prefix and openssldirhas stayed in Configure so far, with Unix paths as defaultsHowever, since we're making Configure increasingly platform agnostic,these defaults need to change and adapt to the platform, along withthe logic to combine themThe easiest to provide for this is to move the logic and the defaultsaway from Configure and into the build filesThis also means that the definition of the macros ENGINESDIR andOPENSSLDIR move away from include/openssl/opensslconfh and into thebuild filesMakefilein is adapted accordingly
NOT BUG:Configure et al: treat C defines separatelyWith some compilers, C macros are defined differently on the commandline than on Unix  It could be that the flad to define them isn't D,it could also be that they need to be grouped together and not be mixedin with the other compiler flags that's how it's done on VMS, forexampleOn Unix family platform configurations, we can continue to have macrodefinitions mixed in with the rest of the flags, so the changes inConfigurations/conf are kept to an absolute minimum

NOT BUG:Simplify the specification of include dirs in the build dirIn buildinfo files, make the include directory in the build directoryabsolute, or Configure will think it should be added to the sourcedirectory top  Configure will turn it into a relative path ifpossible
NOT BUG:Make the processing of buildinfo files more aware of absolute dirsThere were cases where some input was absolute, and concatenating itto the diretory to the source or build top could fail spectacularlyLet's check the input first to see if it's absoluteAnd while we're on the subject of checking if a file or dir spec isabsolute using file_name_is_absolute has its own quirks on VMS,where a logical name is considered absolute under most circumstancesThis is perfectly correct from a VMS point of view, but when parsingthe buildinfo files, we want single word file or directory names toonly be checked syntactically  A function isabsolute that does theright thing is the solution
NOT BUG:Make sure to always include stringh so memset gets declaredmemset is used by CRYPTO_secure_zalloc, which isn't hidden awaybehind IMPLEMENTED

NOT BUG:unified build scheme: adjust test framework for out of source build treeTo be able to run tests when we've built in a directory other thanthe source tree, the testing framework needs a few adjustmentstest/testlib/OpenSSL/Testpm needs to know where it can findshlib_wrapsh, and a number of other tests need to be told a differentplace to find engines than what they may be able to figure out ontheir own  Relying to $TOP is not enough, $SRCTOP and $BLDTOP can beused as an alternativeAs part of this change, top_file and top_dir are removed andsrctop_file, bldtop_file, srctop_dir and bldtop_dir take their place

NOT BUG:Handle SSL_shutdown while in init more appropriately 2Previous commit 7bb196a71 attempted to "fix" a problem with the waySSL_shutdown behaved whilst in midhandshake The original behaviour hadSSL_shutdown return immediately having taken no action if called midhandshake with a return value of 1 meaning everything was shutdownsuccessfully In fact the shutdown has not been successfulCommit 7bb196a71 changed that to send a close_notify anyway and thenreturn This seems to be causing some problems for some applications soperhaps a better much simpler approach is revert to the previousbehaviour no attempt at a shutdown, but return 1 meaning the shutdownwas not successfulThis also fixes a bug where SSL_shutdown always returns 0 when shutdownvery early in the handshake ie we are still using SSLv23_method

NOT BUG:Enhance and clear the support of linker flagsSome time ago, we had a ex_libs configuration setting that could bedivided into lflags and ex_libs  These got divided in two settings,lflags and ex_libs, and the former was interpreted to be generallinking flagsUnfortunately, that conclusion wasn't entirely accurate  Most ofthose linking were meant to end up in a very precise position on thelinking command line, just before the spec of libraries the linkingdepends onBack to the drawing board, we're diving things further, now havinglflags, which are linking flags that aren't depending on command lineposition, plib_lflags, which are linking flags that should show up justbefore the spec of libraries to depend on, and finally ex_libs, whichis the spec of extra libraries to depend onAlso, documentation is changed in Configurations/README  This waspreviously forgotten

NOT BUG:Refactoring BIO: Add a few lines in CHANGES & NEWS
NOT BUG:Refactoring BIO: add a simple networking test of s_client and s_serverThis makes use of TLSProxy, which was expanded to use IO::Socket::IPwhich is a core perl module or IO::Socket::INET6 which is said tobe more popular instead IO::Socket::INET if one of them is installed
NOT BUG:Refactoring BIO: Adapt s_client and s_servers_socketc gets brutally cleaned out and now consists of only twofunctions, one for client and the other for server  They both handleAF_INET, AF_INET6 and additionally AF_UNIX where supported  The restis just easy adaptationBoth s_client and s_server get the new flags 4 and 6 to force theuse of IPv4 or IPv6 onlyAlso, the default host "localhost" in s_client is removed  It's notcertain that this host is set up for both IPv4 and IPv6  For example,Debian has "ip6localhost" as the default hostname for [::1]  Thebetter way is to default |host| to NULL and rely on BIO_lookup toreturn a BIO_ADDRINFO with the appropriate loopback address for IPv4or IPv6 as indicated by the |family| parameter
NOT BUG:Refactoring BIO: Adapt BIO_s_datagram and all that depends on itThe control commands that previously took a struct sockaddr  havebeen changed to take a BIO_ADDR  instead
NOT BUG:Refactoring BIO: add a test, using test/ssltestThis adds a couple of simple tests to see that SSL traffic using thereimplemented BIO_s_accept and BIO_s_connect works as expected,both on IPv4 and on IPv6

NOT BUG:Refactoring BIO: add error macros & text, and make update
NOT BUG:Refactoring BIO: Small adjustmentsBecause of the way bio_lclh is organised, we must not includeinternal/cryptlibh before it  As a matter of fact, bio_lclhincludes internal/cryptlibh on its own
NOT BUG:Refactoring BIO: add wrappers around sockaddr et alBecause different platforms have different levels of support for IPv6,different kinds of sockaddr variants, and some have getaddrinfo et alwhile others don't, we could end up with a mess if ifdefs, duplicatecode and other maintainance nightmaresInstead, we're introducing wrappers around the common form for socketcommunication:BIO_ADDR, closely related to struct sockaddr and some of its variantsBIO_ADDRINFO, closely related to struct addrinfoWith that comes support routines, both convenient creators andaccessors, plus a few utility functions:BIO_parse_hostserv, takes a string of the form host:service andsplits it into host and service  It checks for  in both parts, andconverts any [ipv6address] syntax to ust the IPv6 addressBIO_lookup, looks up information on a hostAll routines handle IPv4 AF_INET and IPv6 AF_INET6 addresses, andthere is support for local sockets AF_UNIX as well

NOT BUG:unified build scheme: add a personal configuration to test itNothing else will run the unified scheme for now
NOT BUG:unified build scheme: add buildinfo filesNow that we have the foundation for the "unified" build scheme inplace, we add buildinfo files  They have been generated from theMakefiles in the same directories  Things that are platform specificwill appear in later commits
NOT BUG:unified build scheme: a first introductionThe "unified" build scheme revolves around small information files,buildinfo, which each describe their own bit of everything that needsto be built, using a minilanguage described in Configurations/READMEThe information in buildinfo file contain references to source filesand final result  Object files are not mentioned at all, they aresimply from source files  Because of this, all the _obj items inConfigurations/conf are renamed to _asm_src and the files listedin the values are change from object files to their correspondingsource files  For the sake of the other build schemes, Configuregenerates corresponding _obj entries in targetFurthermore, the "unified" build scheme supports having a builddirectory tree separate from the source directry treeAll paths in a buildinfo file is assumed to be relative to itslocation, either within the source tree or within the build tree
NOT BUG:Add tests for nonca trusted roots and intermediates
NOT BUG:Compat selfsigned trust with rejectonly aux dataWhen auxiliary data contains only reject entries, continue to trustselfsigned objects just as when no auxiliary data is presentThis makes it possible to reject specific uses without changingwhat's accepted and thus overring the underlying EKUAdded new supported certs and doubled test count from 38 to 76
NOT BUG:Check chain extensions also for trusted certificatesThis includes basic constraints, key usages, issuer EKUs and auxiliarytrust OIDs given a trust suitably related to the intended purposeAdded tests and updated documentation

NOT BUG:Add function to return internal enoding of X509_NAMEPR4280
NOT BUG:Fix opt_imax callNot all architectures have a time_t defined the same way  To makesure we get the same result, we need to cast &checkoffset to intmax_t and make sure that intmax_t is defined somehowTo make really sure we don't pass a variable with the wrong size downto opt_imax, we use a temporary intmax_t
NOT BUG:Configure: Clarify the handling of $thread_cflags

NOT BUG:Missed rc2_int from beforeAlso remove $Makefile variable :
NOT BUG:Fix invalid policy detectionAs a sideeffect of opaque x509, ex_flags were looked up too early,before additional policy cache updates
BUG:Templatize util/domd

NOT BUG:Complete the lflags > lflags/ex_libs transitionSome last lflags to convert to ex_libs or a combo of lflags and ex_libs
NOT BUG:Configure et al: split up the lflags configuration item into twoThe lflags configuration had a weird syntax with a  as separator  Ifit was present, whatever came before ended up as PEX_LIBS in Makefileusually, this is LDFLAGS, while whatever came after ended up asEX_LIBSThis change splits that item into lflags and ex_libs, making their usemore explicitAlso, PEX_LIBS in all the Makefiles are renamed to LDFLAGS
NOT BUG:Make use of add and add_before in Configurations/A few more subjoins could be replaced with calls to add and add_before
NOT BUG:Revert "Don't replace cflags with thread_cflags, only append the latter"This reverts commit a450326ee040c6cbb262debdb1ed731e6700e1e0

NOT BUG:Remove cleandependRemove depend hacks from demos/enginesRemove cleandepend; just call makedepend or $CC M and use that
NOT BUG:Make it possible to check for explicit auxiliary trustBy default X509_check_trust trusts selfsigned certificates fromthe trust store that have no explicit local trust/reject oidsencapsulated as a "TRUSTED CERTIFICATE" object  See the addtrustand trustout options of x5091This commit adds a flag that makes it possible to distinguish betweenthat implicit trust, and explicit auxiliary settingsWith flags | X509_TRUST_NO_SS_COMPAT, a certificate is only trustedvia explicit trust settings
NOT BUG:Always DPURIFYThe use of the uninitialized buffer in the RNG has no real securitybenefits and is only a nuisance when using memory sanitizers
NOT BUG:Remove x86_gcc_des,x86_gcc_optsThis is a followin from !1738, we no longer need those variables
NOT BUG:Add have_precompute_mult testsAdd tests for have_precompute_mult for the optimised curves nistp224,nistp256 and nistp521 if present
NOT BUG:Fix bug in nistp224/256/521 where have_precompute_mult always returns 0During precomputation if the group given is well known then we memcpy awell known precomputation However we go the wrong label in the code anddon't store the data properly Consequently if we call have_precompute_multthe data isn't there and we return 0RT3600
NOT BUG:Add missing return value checksThe function DH_check_pub_key was missing some return value checks insome calls to BN functionsRT4278
NOT BUG:Correct value of DH_CHECK_PUBKEY_INVALIDA new return value for DH_check_pub_key was recently added:DH_CHECK_PUBKEY_INVALID As this is a flag which can be ORed with otherreturn values it should have been set to the value 4 not 3RT4278

NOT BUG:Add a test for small subgroup attacks on DH/DHEFollowing on from the previous commit, add a test to ensure thatDH_compute_key correctly fails if passed a bad y such that:y^q mod p ! 1
NOT BUG:Prevent small subgroup attacks on DH/DHEHistorically OpenSSL only ever generated DH parameters based on "safe"primes More recently in version 102 support was provided forgenerating X942 style parameter files such as those required for RFC5114 support The primes used in such files may not be "safe" Where anapplication is using DH configured with parameters based on primes thatare not "safe" then an attacker could use this fact to find a peer'sprivate DH exponent This attack requires that the attacker completemultiple handshakes in which the peer uses the same DH exponentA simple mitigation is to ensure that y^q mod p  1CVE20160701Issue reported by Antonio Sanso

NOT BUG:Complete the removal of / fooc / commentsSome files that are automatically generated still had those commentsadded by the generating scripts
NOT BUG:Skip all explicitely if the number of tests is 0It seems that Test::More doesn't like 0 tests, a line like this raisesan error and stops the recipe entirely:plan tests > 0;So we need to check for 0 tests beforehand and skip the subtestexplicitely in that case

NOT BUG:SHARED_LIBS_LINK_EXTS is no longer used, remove it completely
NOT BUG:Remove unused, undocumented cleanshared targetAlso removes the make variable SHARED_LIBS_LINK_EXTS, only used bythe cleanshared targetWhen shared library linking was moved to the separate Makefilesharedin commit 30afcc072acd4f70590fec68bf0590da4e4f1883, this target wasskipped  Prior to that commit, cleanshared was invoked as adependency of buildshared, but afterward it was no longer referencedanywhere in the treeInstead of porting the functionality over to Makefileshared, justremove it entirely, as it appears to be unused
NOT BUG:RT4272: Unit tests fail when DTLS disabledMissing SKIP: block in SSL unit tests for DTLS and TLS version tests
NOT BUG:80test_cat is made to use the new perlapp
NOT BUG:Have OpenSSL::Test handle perl scripts like any programSince we're building some of our perl scripts and the result might notend up in apps/ , we may need to treat them like the compileprograms we use for testingThis introduces perlapp and perltest, which behave like app andtest, but will add the perl executable in the command line For example, with a mk1mf build, the result will end up in $BIN_D
NOT BUG:Add SSL_up_ref and SSL_CTX_up_refThe SSL and SSL_CTX structures are reference counted However since libsslwas made opaque there is no way for users of the library to manipulate thereference counts This adds functions to enable that

NOT BUG:Refactor file writing  Remake Makefileorg into a templateIt is time for Makefileorg to fold into the new regime and have a runthrough util/dofilepl  This forces some information out of there andinto Configure, which isn't a bad thing, it makes Configureincreasingly the center of build information, which is as it shouldbeA few extra defaults were needed in the BASE template to get rid ofwarnings about missing values
NOT BUG:Now that Configure doesn't produce tools/c_rehash, mk1mf has to do it
NOT BUG:For every test in 80test_sslt, check that the protocols used is enabled
NOT BUG:Make tests use configdatapm rather than parsing Makefile
NOT BUG:Move & split opensslconfhinMove opensslconfhin to include/opensslSplit off DES,BN,RC4 stuff into separate header filetemplates in crypto/include/internal/_confhin
NOT BUG:Fix OpenSSL::Test::Simple to take more than one algorithmSome test programs may depend on more than just one TLS version, forexample
NOT BUG:Move pqueue into sslThis is an internal facility, never documented, not forpublic consumption  Move it into ssl where it's only usedfor DTLSI also made the typedef's for pqueue and pitem follow our style: theyname structures, not pointers
NOT BUG:Make sure apps/Makefile builds apps/CApl by default
NOT BUG:The rehashtime target should depend on build_tools as wellThe explanation is that it falls back to using tools/c_rehash if'apps/openssl rehash' isn't supported on the platform at hand
NOT BUG:Fix two possible leaksSignedoffby: Kurt Roeckx <kurt@roeckxbe>
NOT BUG:Fix possible memory leak on BUF_MEM_grow_clean failureSimplify BUF_MEM init codeSignedoffby: Kurt Roeckx <kurt@roeckxbe>
NOT BUG:Refactor file writing  make configdatapm the info center for "reconf"Now that configdatapm is the centre of information, use that insteadof Makefile to figure out reconfiguration parameters  This will helpfuture development with different Makefile file namesThe code to read necessary configuration data from Makefile is retainedfor an easy transition to configdatapm based information gathering  Itwill be removed later onThis change includes moving the variable $cross_compile_prefix to config
BUG:String configs are truly deprecated, not even somewhat supported any more
NOT BUG:Remove extra unused variable in util/dofilepl
NOT BUG:Fix store with opaque dataWhen experimentalstore is enabled, it does not compile due to thechange to opaque data structuresChange CRYPTO_add to EVP_PKEY_up_ref as neededSignedoffby: Kurt Roeckx <kurt@roeckxbe>
NOT BUG:free item after sk_push failSignedoffby: Rich Salz <rsalz@opensslorg>
NOT BUG:Disable jpake if psk is disabled
NOT BUG:Refactor file writing  rewrite crypto/opensslconfhin as templateThe turn has come to have crypto/opensslconfhin get run throughutil/dofilepl  The consequence is that a large number of variablesget moved to the config tableAlso, the string variables $openssl_, which were populated with cpplines, all being of the form "define SOMETHING", were converted intoARRAY refs in config values, containing just the list of macros to bedefined
NOT BUG:Refactor file writing  Adapt util/mkdefpl to use configdatapmFor this adaptation, the variables $options and $version needed tomove to config in Configure, and why not move all other variablesholding diverse version numbers at the same time?
NOT BUG:Refactor file writing  information on our use of Perl and Perl modulesThis includes a start on how to install missing modules
NOT BUG:Refactor file writing  adapt util/dofilepl to use with_fallback
NOT BUG:Bundle the non core Perl module Text::TemplateBecause we're using Text::Template and we know it's a non core Perlmodule, we choose to bundle it into our source, for convenienceexternal/perl/Downloadedtxt document what modules we choose to bundlethis way and exactly where we downloaded it fromWith this changes comes the transfer module for with_fallback
NOT BUG:Refactor file writing  arrange for use of bundled Perl modules as fallbackFor our own convenience, we need a mechanism to be able to fall backon bundled Perl modules  It's a minimal package that's called likethis:use with_fallback qwModule1 Module2 ;For each module, it will try to require them from the systeminstallation, and failing that, it will temporarly add external/perland try to require transfer::{ModuleName}  It requires that eachbundled Perl modules is accompanied by a small transfer moduleexternal/perl/transfer/ModuleNamepm in our example that knowsexactly what to load
NOT BUG:Refactor file writing  introduce template driven file writingapps/CApl and tools/c_rehash are built from template files  So far,this was done by Configure, which created its own problems as itforced everyone to reconfigure just because one of the template fileshad changedInstead, have those files created as part of the normal build in apps/and in tools/Furthermore, this prepares for a future where Configure may produceentirely other build files than Makefile, and the latter can't beguaranteed to be the holder of all information for other scriptsInstead, configdatapm described below becomes the center ofconfiguration informationThis introduces a few new things:config         a hash table to hold all kinds of configuration datathat can be used by any other scriptconfigdatapm   a perl module that Configure writes  It currentlyholds the hash tables config and targetutil/dofilepl  a script that takes a template on STDIN and outputsthe result after applying configuration data on itIt's supposed to be called like this:perl I$TOP Mconfigdata < template > resultorperl I$TOP Mconfigdata templ1 templ2  > resultNote: util/dofilepl requires Text::TemplateAs part of this changed, remove a number of variables that are reallyjust copies of entries in target, and use target directly  Theexceptions are $target{cflags} and $target{lflags}, they do get copiedto $cflags and $lflags  The reason for this is that those variablepotentially go through a lot of changes and would rather deserve aplace in config  That, however, is for another commit
NOT BUG:Refactor config  consolidate and refresh print_table_entryIt's time for print_table_entry to get a bit of refreshment  The way itwas put together, we needed to maintain the list of known configurationkeys of interest twice, in different shapes  This is error prone, somove the list of strings to a common list for all printing cases, anduse simple formatting of lines to do the actual printout based on thatlist
NOT BUG:Fix quoting error in SRP printfThe code is trying to interpolate the value of the BASE_SECTION macro,but due to excess escaping, it instead prints the string "BASE_SECTION"Signedoffby: Rich Salz <rsalz@opensslorg>
NOT BUG:Fixed typo in the SSL_CTX_set_security_levelSignedoffby: Rich Salz <rsalz@opensslorg>
NOT BUG:Cleanup gitignoreSome things to ignore need to be properly rooted, and use a bit moreprecision on ignoring 'lib', as that maybe be a perfectly validdirectory name to add into git elsewhere in the source tree
NOT BUG:Configurations  no_asm_filler is long gone, don't use it
NOT BUG:Fix build failure with CIPHER_DEBUGSignedoffby: Rich Salz <rsalz@opensslorg>
NOT BUG:isalist1 is obsolete; use isainfo1Signedoffby: Rich Salz <rsalz@opensslorg>
NOT BUG:Updated OSSL_DYNAMIC_VERSION/OSSL_DYNAMIC_OLDESTChange to reflect changes in dynamic_fnsSignedoffby: Rich Salz <rsalz@opensslorg>
NOT BUG:dsatest: use the correct BIO to print the test errorSignedoffby: Rich Salz <rsalz@opensslorg>
NOT BUG:few typo fixesSignedoffby: Rich Salz <rsalz@opensslorg>
BUG:Remove outdated conftestc
NOT BUG:Refactor config  @MK1MF_Builds out, general build scheme inTime to get rid of @MK1MF_Builds and introduce a more flexible'build_scheme' configuration key  Its value may be a string or anarray of strings, meaning we need to teach resolve_config how tohandle ARRAY referensesThe build scheme is a word that selects a function to create theappropriate result files for a certain configuration  Currently validbuild schemes aer "mk1mf" and "unixmake", the plan is however to addat least one other for a more universal build schemeIncidently, this also adds the functions 'add' and 'add_before', whichcan be used in a configuration, so instead of having to repeatedlywrite a sub like this:key1 > sub { join" ", @_, "myvalues"; },key2 > sub { join" ", "myvalues", @_; },one could write this:key1 > add" ", "myvalues",key2 > add_before" ", "myvalues",The good point with 'add' and 'add_before' is that they handleinheritances where the values are a misture of scalars and ARRAYs  Ifthere are any ARRAY to be found, the resulting value will be an ARRAY,otherwise it will be a scalar with all the incoming valued joinedtogether with the separator given as first argument to add/add_before
NOT BUG:Refactor config  move templates and template docs to ConfigurationsMove the documentation of the target configuration form toConfigurations/READMEMove initial assembler object templates toConfigurations/00BASEtemplatesconfFurthermore, remove all variables containing the names of thenonassembler object files and make a BASE template of them insteadThe  values from this templates are used as defaults as is  Theremaining manipulation of data when assembler modules are used is doneonly when $no_asm is falseWhile doing this, clean out some other related variables that aren'tused anywhereAlso, we had to move the resolution of the chosen target a bit, or thefunction 'asm' would never catch a true $no_asm  this hasn'tmattered before we've moved it all to the BASE template, but now itdoesAt the same time, add the default for the 'unistd' key to the BASEtemplate
NOT BUG:Refresh the thinking of prefix and openssldirprefix is now exclusively used for software and manual installationopenssldir is not exclusively used as a default location for certs,keys and the default opensslcnfThis change is made to bring clarity, to have the two lessintertwined, and to be more compatible with the usual ways of softwareinstallationPlease change your habits and scripts to use prefix rather thanopenssldir for installation location now
NOT BUG:RT3863 ECC: Add missing NULL check Set a flag
NOT BUG:Refactor config  throw away the last remains of 'testsanity'
NOT BUG:Refactor config  consolidate handling of disabled stuffIt's time to refactor the handling of disabled so that allinformation of value is in the same place  We have so far had a fewcascading disable rules in form of code, far away from disabledInstead, bring that information to the array @disable_cascade, whichis a list of pairs of the form 'test > descendents'  The test partcan be a string, and it's simply checked if that string is a key indisabled, or it can be a CODEref to do a more complex test  If thetest comes true, then all descendents are disabled  This check isperformed until there are no more things that need to be disabledAlso, $default_depflags is constructed from the information indisabled instead of being a separate string  While a string of itsown is visually appealing, it's much too easy to forget to update itwhen something is changed in disabled
NOT BUG:Refactor config  rewrite handling of "reconf"The way the "reconf"/"reconfigure" argument is handled is overlycomplicated  Just grep for it first, and if it is there in thecurrent arguments, get the old command line arguments from MakefileWhile we're at it, make the Makefile variable CONFIGURE_ARGS hold thevalue as a perl list of strings  This makes things much safer in caseone of the arguments would contain a space  Since CONFIGURE_ARGS isused for nothing else, there's no harm in this
NOT BUG:Multiple trusted/untrusted/CRLfile options in verifyIt is sometimes useful especially in automated tests to supplymultiple trusted or untrusted certificates via separate files ratherthan have to prepare a single file containing them allTo that end, change verify1 to accept these options zero or moretimes  Also automatically set noCAfile and noCApath whentrusted is specifiedImprove verify1 documentation, which could still use some work
NOT BUG:Refactor apps load_certs/load_crls to work incrementally
NOT BUG:More X509_verify_cert tests via verify1Still need tests for trustedfirst and tests that probe constructionof alternate chains
NOT BUG:Reject when explicit trust EKU are set and none matchReturning untrusted is enough for for full chains that end inselfsigned roots, because when explicit trust is specified itsuppresses the default blanket trust of selfsigned objectsBut for partial chains, this is not enough, because absent a similartrustselfsigned policy, non matching EKUs are indistinguishablefrom lack of EKU constraintsTherefore, failure to match any trusted purpose must trigger anexplicit reject
NOT BUG:Commit pregenerated test_verify certsThese can be regenerated via:cd test/certs; /setupshif need be  The keys are all RSA 2048bit keys, but it is possibleto change that via environment variablescd test/certsrm f keypem key2pemOPENSSL_KEYALGrsa OPENSSL_KEYBITS3072 /setupshcd test/certsrm f keypem key2pemOPENSSL_KEYALGecdsa OPENSSL_KEYBITSsecp384r1 /setupshKeys are reused if already present, so the environment variablesare only used when generating any keys that are missing  Hencethe "rm f"
NOT BUG:Scripts to generate verify test certs
NOT BUG:Check SuiteB constraints with EE DANE recordsWhen DANEEE3 matches or either of DANEEE/PKIXEE fails, we don'tbuild a chain at all, but rather succeed or fail with just the leafcertificate  In either case also check for SuiteB violationsAs unlikely as it may seem that anyone would enable both DANE andSuiteB, we should do what the application asksTook the opportunity to eliminate the "cb" variables in x509_vfyc,just call ctx>verify_cbok, ctx
NOT BUG:Refactor config  split read_config into read_config and resolve_configSplit the read_config function into read_config that ONLY reads theconfiguration files but doesn't try to resolve any of theinheritances, and resolve_config which resolves the inheritance chainof a given target  Move them to the bottom of Configure, with therest of the helpersHave a new small hash table, target, which will hold the values forthe target the user requested  This also means that all access to thecurrent target data can be reduced from '$table{$target}>{key}' to amere '$target{key}'While we're at it, the old string formatted configurations are gettingobsolete, so they may as well get deprecated entirely
NOT BUG:Refactor config  throw away 'testsanity'Get rid of the testsanity option  Since we no longer have stringbased configurations, we don't have the problem with miscountingcolons any more
NOT BUG:Refactor config  a small cosmetic touchup of ConfigureStart simple, removed some unused variables and change all '<<EOF' to'<<"EOF"'  The latter is because some code colorizers notably, inemacs cannot recognise the here document end marker unless it'squoted and therefore assume the rest of the file is part of the heredocument
NOT BUG:Add an engine destructor to eng_cryptodev
NOT BUG:Adapt BSD cryptodev engine to opaque EVP_MD_CTX, EVP_CIPHER_CTX, etc
NOT BUG:Remove update tagsAlso remove depend/local_depend
NOT BUG:Consolidate "make update"Rename 'update' to 'generate'  Rather than recurse, just explicitlycall the three generate targets directly
NOT BUG:Handle SSL_shutdown while in init more appropriatelyCalling SSL_shutdown while in init previously gave a "1" response, meaningeverything was successfully closed down even though it wasn't Better isto send our close_notify, but fail when trying to receive oneThe problem with doing a shutdown while in the middle of a handshake isthat once our close_notify is sent we shouldn't really do anything elseincluding process handshake/CCS messages until we've received aclose_notify back from the peer However the peer might send a CCS beforeacting on our close_notify  so we won't be able to read it because we'renot acting on CCS messages!
NOT BUG:make EVP_PKEY opaque
NOT BUG:Remove the GOST engineThe GOST engine is now out of date and is removed by this commit An upto date GOST engine is now being maintained in an external repositorySee:https://wikiopensslorg/indexphp/Binaries
NOT BUG:Fix BSD rpath parameterFor BSD systems, Configure adds a shared_ldflags including a referenceto the Makefile variable LIBRPATH, but since it must be passed down toMakefileshared, care must be taken so the value of LIBRPATH doesn'tget expanded too early, or it ends up giving an empty string
NOT BUG:API compat for SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms
NOT BUG:Validate ClientHello session_id field length and send alert on failureRT4080
NOT BUG:prf redirection build fixes
NOT BUG:Update license year range to 2016Signedoffby: Rich Salz <rsalz@opensslorg>
NOT BUG:Support disabling any or all TLS or DTLS versionsSome users want to disable SSL 30/TLS 10/TLS 11, and enable justTLS 12  In the future they might want to disable TLS 12 andenable just TLS 13, This commit makes it possible to disable any or all of the TLS orDTLS protocols  It also considerably simplifies the SSL/TLS tests,by autogenerating the min/max version tests based on the set ofsupported protocols 425 explicitly written out tests got replacedby two loops that generate all 425 tests if all protocols areenabled, fewer otherwise
NOT BUG:Add documentation for EVP_PKEY_TLS1_PRF
NOT BUG:add TLS1PRF tests
NOT BUG:Add TLS1PRF test support to evp_test
NOT BUG:use TLS PRFModify libssl to use EVP_PKEY TLS PRF
NOT BUG:Add TLS PRF methodAdd EVP_PKEY algorithm for TLS1 PRF
NOT BUG:Fix GOST2012NULLGOST12Fix a typo in the definition of the GOST2012NULLGOST12 ciphersuiteRT4213
NOT BUG:Drop cached certificate signature validity flagIt seems risky in the context of crosssigned certificates when thesame certificate might have multiple potential issuers  Also rarelyused, since chains in OpenSSL typically only employ selfsignedtrustanchors, whose selfsignatures are not checked, while untrustedcertificates are generally ephemeral
NOT BUG:Don't use "grep q", "q" is not POSIX, and fails on Solaris
NOT BUG:Add some extra Cygwin targets as aliases for Cygwinx86Cygwin was used for x86 before, so let's keep it around for those whostill use it it make Configure reconf possibleCygwini[3456]86 for those that might generate and pass a target namedirectly to Configure
NOT BUG:Adjust the configuration target name from Cygwini686 to Cygwinx86This is to reflect that it's not limited to just i686
NOT BUG:Fix configuration system to support different architectures on CygwinThis patch allows to recognize the architectures supported by Cygwinand to choose the right configuration from there  Drop march touse default architecture on 32 bit x86Drop preCygwin13 recognition since it's long gone and there's novalid configuration for this anymoreSignedoffby: Corinna Vinschen <vinschen@redhatcom>

NOT BUG:Start a new line after each sentenceending periodThis avoids explicit double spaces between sentences
NOT BUG:Make SSL_dane_enable requirement more clearAlso s/s/ssl/ as appropriate in the code exampleSuggested by Claus Assmann
BUG:Better invalid SNI name error handlingAlso report an SSL_dane_enable error when the basedomain is aninvalid SNI name  Avoid sideeffects when such a name is validwith X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host, as eg with an empty name, bysetting the SNI name first

NOT BUG:Update Windows installation instructionsThe windows installation instructions were very out of date Substantialupdate to the text Remove a lot of historical stuff that isn't relevantany more, and merge the win64 and win32 instructions into one file
NOT BUG:Rename INSTALLW32 to INSTALLWINAlso remove the INSTALLW64 file Next commit will update INSTALLWIN tocover both
NOT BUG:Small fixup, an extra line slipped inThe previous 'Relax the requirements for a debug build' commit hadan extra line of code that shouldn't have been there  This fixes it
NOT BUG:Cosmetic polish for lastresort depth 0 check
NOT BUG:Avoid the r modifier for s/// perlIt seems that the r modifier for s/// is fairly new  It's reportednot to exist in perl 5101, so it's better to avoid it whenpossible
NOT BUG:Fix lastresort depth 0 check when the chain has multiple certificates
NOT BUG:Add a noegd option to disable EGDrelated codeThe entropygathering daemon is used only on a small number of machinesProvide a configure knob so that EGD support can be disabled by defaultbut reenabled on those systems that do need it
NOT BUG:Make SSL_set_debug deprecated in 11
NOT BUG:Always initialize X509_STORE_CTX get_crl pointer
BUG:Editorial
NOT BUG:In __cwd, make sure the given directory is seen as such and not a fileOn Unixly platforms, this doesn't matter  On VMS, it does
NOT BUG:Relax the requirements for a debug buildWe required that a target be named 'debugsomething' or to have atleast one of the configuration items debug_cflags and debug_lflags fordebug to be acceptedHowever, there are targets with no such markings but that will stillhave debugging capabilities  This is particularly true for mk1mfbuilds, where the extra flags for debugging are figured out later onby util/mk1mfpl
NOT BUG:RT4232: Extra space in help messageIt turns out that pause calls the undocumented function SSL_set_debugThat just sets flag inside the SSL structure  That flag, despitethe command is never used  So remove the flag, the field, and thefunction

NOT BUG:Change the last copyright year to 2016 in README
NOT BUG:VMS open doesn't take O_BINARY, but takes a context descriptionTell open O_BINARY on VMS doesn't make sense, as it's possible touse more precise file attributes  However, if we're still going tofdopen it in binary mode, we must set the fd in binary context
NOT BUG:Rename binmode into textmode and use it correctly
NOT BUG:Do not use redirection on binary filesOn some platforms, the shell will determine what attributes a filewill have, so while the program might think it's safely outputtingbinary data, it's not always trueFor the sake of the tests, it's therefore safer to use out than touse redirection
NOT BUG:Fall back to c_rehash if 'openssl rehash' fails'openssl rehash' isn't implemented on all platforms, and since 'maketest' depends on a rehash of certs/demo being performed, it becomes aneffective block from running tests on any platform but Unix, for themomentIt's better to fall back to c_rehash and let the tests performeverywhere
NOT BUG:Call single parent free_comp routine
NOT BUG:To avoid possible time_t overflow use X509_time_adj_ex
NOT BUG:Fix doublefree bugs in EC group precomputation state
NOT BUG:Add a directry spec for mcr if there is noneOn VMS, the command MCR will assume SYS$SYSTEM: when the firstargument lacks a directory spec  So for programs in the currentdirectory, we add [] to tell MCR it is in the current directoryIt's the same as having / at the start of a program on Unix so theshell doesn't start looking along $PATH
NOT BUG:Fix verify1 to report failure when verification failsRegenerated expired test certificates, good for the next 100 years
NOT BUG:Fix nistp512 typos, should be nistp521Note, this now compiles, but fails tests, so further remediationis required
NOT BUG:Add missing ifdef's to fix build break
NOT BUG:For stro[ui]max require both C99 and UINTMAX_MAX/INTMAX_MAX
NOT BUG:Fix test_ordinalsThis used to work but somewhere along the line it broke and was failing todetect duplicate ordinals  which was the whole point of the test!
NOT BUG:Reorder the ordinals in libeaynum
NOT BUG:Remove spurious ;
NOT BUG:Quick fix of debugging option for mk1mfplutil/mk1mfpl was relying on the platform having the 'debug' prefixfor doing a debug build  Since the setup of targets has changed, thisis no longer true  However, it can look for 'debug' in the commandline options
NOT BUG:VMS C doesn't provide intmax_t/uinmax_t, use our own
NOT BUG:Add CRYPTO_EX_DATA; remove EC_EXTRA_DATAAdd CRYPTO_EX_DATA add EndC_KEY_[gs]et_method, From Roumen PetrovHad to add various exdata calls to init/copy/free the exdataHad to remove const from some EC functions because exdata isn'tconstcorrect :Also remove EC_EXTRA_DATA and use a union to hold the possibleprecomputed values and an enum to tell which value is in theunion Rich Salz
NOT BUG:Remove test_probable_prime_coprime from test/bntestcThis test relies on a private function, which isn't exportedThis test would work better as a unit test in crypto/bn/bn_primec
NOT BUG:Simplify the EXIT macrot for VMS
NOT BUG:recognise nocryptomdebug
NOT BUG:VMS perl doesn't implement fork, so don't run the TLSProxy tests there
NOT BUG:Fix DES_LONG breakageFor some strange reason opensslconfh was only defining DES_LONGwhen included via desh, but that's exceedingly fragile as aresult of include guards the include via desh might not actuallyprocess the content againRipped out the nesting constraint, now always define OSSL_DES_LONGif not already defined  Note, this could just be DES_LONG, buttrying to avoid exposing DES_LONG in places where it has never beenseen before, so it is up to desh to actually define DES_LONG asOSSL_DES_LONG
NOT BUG:For stroimax need C99 inttypesh
NOT BUG:Don't return from main, use EXIT instead
NOT BUG:Have the VMS exit code follow POSIX conventionsIt seems like the convention for VMS exit codes is to combine the VMSC facility code 0x35a000 with a recoded exit code as follows:0     > 11255 > 8code + 2We also add 0x10000000, which is the control bit that has DCL notreport the error on the terminal  That's just as well, since it wouldbe quite nonsensical, for example:CWNOMSG, Message number 0035A018We could do all this by using the normal exit function after havingdefined the macro _POSIX_EXIT  Unfortunately, this feature onlyexists in VMS C V71 and up
NOT BUG:After EVP_CIPHER turned opaque, e_rc5c needs to include evp_inthWe missed this one because rc5 is disabled by defaultNotified by The Doctor <doctor@doctornl2kabca>
NOT BUG:Pipes on VMS do not work well with binary data, use an intermediary fileVMS being a record oriented operating system, it's uncertain how the'pipe' passes binary data from one process to another  Experienceshows that we get in trouble, and it's probably due to the pipe initself being opened in text mode variable length recordsIt's safer to pass data via an intermediary file instead
NOT BUG:Fix test/recipes/80test_cat to work on VMSVMS uses a variant of opensslcnf named opensslvmscnfThere's a Perl on VMS mystery where a open pipe will not SIGPIPE whenthe child process exits, which means that a loop sending "y\n" to itwill never stop  Adding a counter helps fix this set to 10, we knowthat none of the CApl commands will require more
NOT BUG:VMS will downcase all command parameters unless they're quoted
NOT BUG:Fix missing casts for c++

NOT BUG:Adapt the internal EVP routines to opaque EVP_CIPHER
NOT BUG:Make EVP_CIPHER opaque and add creator/destructor/accessor/writer functionsWe follow the method used for EVP_MDAlso, move all the internal EVP_CIPHER building macros from evp_loclhto evp_inth  This will benefit our builtin EVP_CIPHERs
NOT BUG:Remove EVP_CIPHER_CTX_flags, it's only confusingEVP_CIPHER_CTX_flags was returning the flags of its associatedEVP_CIPHER  However, EVP_CIPHER_CTX has flags of its own, so thisfunction is quite confusing and therefore error prone
NOT BUG:Adapt all EVP_CIPHER_CTX users for it becoming opaque

NOT BUG:Make sure to have both upper and mixed case symbols in SYMBOL_VECTORIt was assumed that the syntax FOO/FooPROCEDURE would create both anupper case and mixed case symbol in the GST  Not so, it requireshaving both FOO/FooPROCEDURE to create the upper case alias andFooPROCEDURE to create the mixed case slotWe make sure that any symbol always occupies two slots even thosethat don't exist by filling up with SPARE when necessary  That willassure that any changes will still have the same symbols in the sameslots no matter what save a complete rewrite of the ordinals files
BUG:Use SPARE instead of PRIVATE_PROCEDURE to reserve unused SYMBOL_VECTOR slotsIt was assumed that a dummy with the type PRIVATE_PROCEDURE wouldsimply occupy a slot but otherwise ignore the symbol  Not so, butthere is SPARE for that purpose
NOT BUG:The limit per SYMBOL_VECTOR isn't the amount of symbols, it's the line length

NOT BUG:Fix a possible memleakIf there's a failure allocating md_data, the destination pctx will havea shared pointer with the source EVP_MD_CTX, which will lead to problemswhen either the source or the destination is freed
NOT BUG:Protocol version selection and negotiation rewriteThe protocol selection code is now consolidated in a few consecutiveshort functions in a single file and is table driven  Protocolspecificconstraints that influence negotiation are moved into the flagsfield of the method structure  The same protocol version constraintsare now applied in all code paths  It is now much easier to addnew protocol versions without reworking the protocol selectionlogicIn the presence of "holes" in the list of enabled client protocolswe no longer select client protocols below the hole based on asubset of the constraints and then fail shortly after when it isfound that these don't meet the remaining constraints suiteb, FIPS,security level,   Ideally, with the new min/max controls userswill be less likely to create "holes" in the first place

NOT BUG:Adapt the rest of the source to the removal of EVP_MD_CTX|HMAC_CTX_cleanup
NOT BUG:Remove HMAC_CTX_cleanup and combine its functionality into EVP_MD_CTX_initThis follows the same idea as the combination of EVP_MD_CTX_cleanupand EVP_MD_CTX_init into one function
NOT BUG:Remove EVP_MD_CTX_cleanup and put its functionality into EVP_MD_CTX_initThe idea is that with EVP_MD_CTX_create and EVP_MD_CTX_destroy,EVP_MD_CTX_cleanup and EVP_MD_CTX_init is not used the same as beforeInstead, we need a single function that can be used to reinitialise anexisting EVP_MD_CTX that's been created with EVP_MD_CTX_createpreviously  Combining EVP_MD_CTX_cleanup and EVP_MD_CTX_init intothat one function is the answer
NOT BUG:Adapt the rest of the source to the opaque HMAC_CTX
NOT BUG:Make the definition of HMAC_CTX opaqueThis moves the definition to crypto/hmac/hmac_lclh  Constructor anddestructor added, and the typedef moved to include/openssl/ossl_typh
NOT BUG:Add inclusion of internal/evp_inth to all crypto/ files that need itThese are the files that add new EVP_MDs
NOT BUG:Adapt all engines that add new EVP_MDs
NOT BUG:Have the few apps that accessed EVP_MD directly use accessors instead
NOT BUG:Make the definition of EVP_MD opaqueThis moves the definition to crypto/include/internal/evp_inth anddefines all the necessary method creators, destructors, writers andaccessors  The name standard for the latter is inspired from thecorresponding functions to manipulate UI methods
NOT BUG:Adjust all accesses to EVP_MD_CTX to use accessor functions
NOT BUG:Document the changed HMAC API
NOT BUG:Adapt HMAC to the EVP_MD_CTX changesThis change required some special treatment, as HMAC is intertwinedwith EVP_MD  For now, all local HMAC_CTX variables MUST beinitialised with HMAC_CTX_EMPTY, or whatever happens to be on thestack will be mistaken for actual pointers to EVP_MD_CTX  This willchange as soon as HMAC_CTX becomes opaqueAlso, since HMAC_CTX_init can fail now, its return type changes fromvoid to int, and it will return 0 on failure, 1 on success
NOT BUG:Have other crypto/evp files include evp_loclhNote: this does not include the files in crypto/evp that are justinstanciations of EVP_MD
NOT BUG:Make the definition of EVP_MD_CTX opaqueThis moves the definitionto crypto/evp/evp_loclh, along with a fewassociated accessor macros  A few accessor/writer functions added

NOT BUG:Make SSL_{CTX}_set_tmp_ecdh call SSL_{CTX_}set1_curvesSSL_{CTX}_set_tmp_ecdh allows to set 1 EC curve and then tries to use it  Onthe other hand SSL_{CTX_}set1_curves allows you to set a list of curves, butonly when SSL_{CTX_}set_ecdh_auto was called to turn it on
NOT BUG:Remove support for SSL_{CTX_}set_tmp_ecdh_callbackThis only gets used to set a specific curve without actually checking that thepeer supports it or not and can therefor result in handshake failures that canbe avoided by selecting a different cipher

NOT BUG:Add documentation for BN_with_flagsFollowing on from the previous commit this adds some documentation for theBN_with_flags function which is easy to misuse
NOT BUG:Tighten up BN_with_flags usage and avoid a reachable assertThe function rsa_ossl_mod_exp uses the function BN_with_flags to create atemporary copy local_r1 of a BIGNUM r1 with modified flags Thistemporary copy shares some state with the original r1 If the state of r1gets updated then local_r1's state will be stale This was occurring in thefunction so that when local_r1 was freed a call to bn_check_top was madewhich failed an assert due to the stale state To resolve this we must freelocal_r1 immediately after we have finished using it and not wait until theend of the functionThis problem prompted a review of all BN_with_flag usage within thecodebase All other usage appears to be correct, although often notobviously so This commit refactors things to make it much clearer forthese other uses

NOT BUG:Fix a rebase errorDuring rebasing of the async changes some error codes ended up beingduplicated so that "make errors" fails This removes the duplication
NOT BUG:Async error handling and MacOS/X fixesIn the async code for MacOS/X define _XOPEN_SOURCE if not alreadydefined as early as possible  We must do this before includingany header files, because on MacOS/X <stlibh> includes <signalh>which includes <ucontexth>  If we delay defining _XOPEN_SOURCEand include <ucontexth> after various system headers are included,we are very likely to end up with the wrong truncated definitionof ucontext_tAlso, better error handling and some code cleanup in POSIX fibreconstruction and destruction  We make sure that async_fibre_makecontextalways initializes the fibre to a state that can be freedFor all implementations, check for error returns fromasync_fibre_makecontext

NOT BUG:Good hygiene with size_t output argumentThough the callers check the function return value and ignore thesize_t output argument on failure, it is still often not ideal tostore 1 in size_t on error  That might signal an unduly largebuffer  Instead set the size_t to 0, to indicate no space
NOT BUG:Implement windows async thread local variable supportImplements Thread Local Storage in the windows async port This also hassome knock on effects to the posix and null implementations
BUG:Convert __thread to pthreads for Thread Local StorageIn theory the pthreads approach for Thread Local Storage should be moreportableThis also changes some APIs in order to accommodate this change Inparticular ASYNC_init_pool is renamed ASYNC_init_thread andASYNC_free_pool is renamed ASYNC_cleanup_thread Also introduced ASYNC_initand ASYNC_cleanup
NOT BUG:Simplify async pool handlingA lot of the pool handling code was in the arch specific files, but wasactually boiler plate and the same across the implementations This commitmoves as much code as possible out of the arch specific files
NOT BUG:Swap to using proper windows pipesWe were using _pipe to create a pipe on windows This uses the "int" typefor its file descriptor for compatibility However most windows functionsexpect to use a "HANDLE" Probably we could get away with just casting butit seems more robust to use the proper type and main stream windowsfunctions
NOT BUG:Fix some style issuesThere were a number of places where the async code did not conform to theOpenSSL coding style
NOT BUG:Fix async deadlock problemThe rand code can aquire locks and then attempt crypto operations Thiscan end up in a deadlock if we are using an async engine, because controlreturns back to the user code whilst still holding the lock We need toforce synchronous operation for these sections of code
NOT BUG:Add ASYNC_block_pause and ASYNC_unblock_pauseThere are potential deadlock situations that can occur if code executingwithin the context of a job aquires a lock, and then pauses the job Thisadds an ability to temporarily block pauses from occuring whilst performingwork and holding a lock
NOT BUG:Remove ASYNC NOEXIST functions from libeaynumDuring development some functions got added and then later taken awaySince these will never appear in a production version there is no reasonfor them to appear in libeaynum flagged as "NOEXIST"
NOT BUG:Further OSX deprecated warnings tweakEven with _XOPEN_SOURCE defined OSX still displays warnings thatmakecontext and friends are deprecated This isn't a problem until youtry and build with strictwarnings, and the build fails This changesuppresses the warnings We know they are deprecated but there is noalternative!
NOT BUG:Fix bug in async_fibre_makecontext for POSIXasync_fibre_makecontext was initialise the fibre first and then callinggetcontext It should be the other way around because the getcontextcall may overwrite some of the things we just initialised This didn'tcause an issue on Linux and so the problem went unnoticed On OSX itcauses a crash
NOT BUG:Rename start_async_job to ssl_start_async_jobMake it clear that this function is ssl specific
NOT BUG:Rename some daysnc functions for consistencyFor some reason the dasync sha1 functions did not start with thedasync prefix like all of the other functions do Changed forconsistency
NOT BUG:Add clarification to docs on ASYNC_free_poolClarify that you must only call this after all async jobs havecompleted  otherwise you could get memory leaks
NOT BUG:Fix compilation error on OSXOSX complains if we don't have _XOPEN_SOURCE defined
NOT BUG:Fix clang errorsMake clang build without errors in the async code
BUG:Swap to using _longjmp/_setjmp instead of longjmp/setjmp_longjmp/_setjmp do not manipulate the signal mask whilstlongjmp/setjmp may do Online sources suggest this could resultin a significant speed up in the context switching
NOT BUG:Fix Linux crashIf config'd without d debug, asynctest was crashing with: longjmp causes uninitialized stack frame This is because gcc will add certain checks for some functionsincluding longjmp The checks assume you can only longjmp down thestack not up However, if we are actually jumping to a differentfibre then it can appear as if we are going up the stack when we arenot really This change disables the check
NOT BUG:Tweak async documentation based on feedbackAdd some clarifications to the async documentation Also changedASYNC_pause_job so that it returns success if you are not within thecontext of a job This is so that engines can be used either asynchronouslyor synchronously and can treat an error from ASYNC_pause_job as a realerror

NOT BUG:Fix windows compilation warningsFix some warnings in the async code when compiling on windows

NOT BUG:Fix pools for s_clients_client was not freeing up the async pool if async mode was enabled
NOT BUG:Fix s_server bugIf an async event occurs during a renegotiation in SSL_read then s_serverwas looping around, detecting we were in init and callinginit_ssl_connection instead of recalling SSL_read
NOT BUG:Implement local thread poolsImplement the ASYNC_JOB as a local thread pool Remove the API supportfor global pools
NOT BUG:Initial Async notify code changesInitial API implemented for notifying applications that an ASYNC_JOBhas completed Currently only s_server is using this The Dummy Asyncengine "cheats" in that it notifies that it has completed before itpauses the job A normal async engine would not do thatOnly the posix version of this has been implemented so far, so it willprobably fail to compile on Windows at the moment
NOT BUG:Add ASYNC_JOB poolsIt is expensive to create the ASYNC_JOB objects due to the "makecontext"call This change adds support for pools of ASYNC_JOB objects so that wedon't have to create a new ASYNC_JOB every time we want to use one
BUG:Use longjmp at setjmp where possibleWhere we can we should use longjmp and setjmp in preference to swapcontext/setcontext as they seem to be more performant
NOT BUG:Fix s_server WWW with asyncThe s_server option WWW was not async aware, and therefore was nothandling SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC conditions This commit fixes that
NOT BUG:Async clean upsRemoved the function ASYNC_job_is_waiting as it was redundant The onlytime user code has a handle on a job is when one is waiting, so all theyneed to do is check whether the job is NULL Also did some cleanups tomake sure the job really is NULL after it has been freed!
NOT BUG:Increase stack sizeSome assembler code puts a lot of stuff on the stack, so up the stack size
NOT BUG:Add null async implementationCreate a "null" async implementation for platforms that lack support Thisjust does nothing when called and therefore performs synchronously
NOT BUG:Async port to windows
NOT BUG:Various windows build fixes to prepare for windows port
NOT BUG:Add s_server and s_client async supportA new async option is added which activates SSL_MODE_ASYNC AlsoSSL_WANT_ASYNC errors are handled appropriately
NOT BUG:Make libssl async awareThe following entry points have been made async aware:SSL_acceptSSL_readSSL_writeAlso added is a new mode  SSL_MODE_ASYNC Calling the above functions withthe async mode enabled will initiate a new async job If an async pause isencountered whilst executing the job such as for example if using SHA1/RSAwith the Dummy Async engine, then the above functions return withSSL_WANT_ASYNC Calling the functions again with exactly the same argsas per nonblocking IO, will resume the job where it left off
NOT BUG:Add the Dummy Async engine dasyncThis engine is for developers of async aware applications It simulatesasynchronous activity with external hardware This initial version supportsSHA1 and RSA Certain operations using those algorithms have async job"pauses" in them  using the new libcrypto async capability
NOT BUG:Add async sublibrary to libcryptoProvides support for running asynchronous jobs Currently this is completelystand alone Future commits will integrate this into libssl and s_server/s_client An asynchronous capable engine will be required to see any benefitfrom this capability
NOT BUG:Add pthread supportThe forthcoming async code needs to use pthread thread local variables Thisupdates the various Configurations to add the necessary flags In many casesthis is an educated guess as I don't have access to most of theseenvironments! There is likely to be some tweaking needed

NOT BUG:Remove redundant check from tls1_get_curvelistThe function tls1_get_curvelist has an explicit check to see if s>certis NULL or not However the check appears after calling the tls1_suitebmacro which derefs s>cert In reality s>cert can never be NULL becauseit is created in SSL_new If the malloc fails then the SSL_new call failsand no SSL object is created

NOT BUG:Don't finish the handshake twiceWe finish the handshake when we move into the TLS_ST_OK state At variouspoints we were also unnecessarily finishing it when we were reading/writingthe Finished message It's much simpler just to do it in TLS_ST_OK, soremove the other calls
NOT BUG:Rebuild error source filesRebuild error source files: the new mkerrpl functionality will nowpick up and translate static function names properly

NOT BUG:Clarify the preferred way of creating patch filesClarify that git formatpatch output is preferred for creating patch files
NOT BUG:Remove a reachable assert from ssl3_write_bytesA buggy application that call SSL_write with a different length after aNBIO event could cause an OPENSSL_assert to be reached The assert is notactually necessary because there was an explicit check a little furtherdown that would catch this scenario Therefore remove the assert an movethe check a little higher up

NOT BUG:Remove superfluous check|tls_process_finished| was checking that |peer_finish_md_len| wasnonnegative However neither |tls1_final_finish_mac| or|ssl3_final_finish_mac| can ever return a negative value, so the check issuperfluous
NOT BUG:Change SSL_state_string return strings to start with a TDue the rest of the state machine changes it makes sense to change theSSL_state_string return strings from 3 to T They are not SSL3 specific
NOT BUG:Change snprintf to memcpyThere was a few uses of snprintf in the DTLS SCTP code which made moresense to be a memcpy
NOT BUG:Add ossl_statem prefix to various functionsAdd the ossl_statem prefix to various funtions to avoid name clashes
NOT BUG:Convert enums to typedefsVarious enums were introduced as part of the state machine rewrite As amatter of style it is preferred for these to be typedefs
NOT BUG:Make dtls1_link_min_mtu staticThe function dtls1_link_min_mtu was only used within d1_libc so makeit static
NOT BUG:Fix a bogus clang warningClang with strictwarnings was complaining about an uninitalisedvariable In reality it will never be used uninitialised but clang can'tfigure out the logic, so just init it anyway to silence the warning
NOT BUG:Fix empty NewSessionTicket processingRebasing the state machine code introduced a problem with emptyNewSessionTicket processing The return value from thetls_process_new_session_ticket is supposed to be an enum, but a bareinteger was being used Unfortunately this is valid C so the compilerdoesn't pick it up

NOT BUG:Fix unitialised variable problemtls_process_client_hello failed to initialise the |al| variable in someerror scenarios This could cause issues with creating the alert
NOT BUG:Fix DTLSv1_listen following state machine changesAdding the new state machine broke the DTLSv1_listen code becausecalling SSL_in_before was erroneously returning true after DTLSv1_listenhad successfully completed This change ensures that SSL_in_before returnsfalse
NOT BUG:Add a function to get the info_callbackRemove repeated blocks of checking SSL and then SSL_CTX for theinfo_callback
NOT BUG:Remove the old state definesRemove all the defines for the old state machines states Mapping old to newis probably going to cause more problems than it solves so it is probablybetter to just remove them
NOT BUG:Change SUB_STATE_RETURN into a typedef

NOT BUG:Remove SSL_state and SSL_set_stateSSL_state has been replaced by SSL_get_state and SSL_set_state is no longersupported

BUG:Remove extraneous parens
NOT BUG:Change statem prefix to ossl_statemChange various state machine functions to use the prefix ossl_stateminstead
NOT BUG:Don't depend on SSL structure internalsThe macros SSL_in_connect_init and SSL_in_accept_init inadvertentlydepended on SSL structure internals This fixes it to use public API callsinstead
NOT BUG:Change HANDSHAKE_STATE to OSSL_HANDSHAKE_STATERename the enum HANDSHAKE_STATE to OSSL_HANDSHAKE_STATE to ensure there areno namespace clashes, and convert it into a typedef
NOT BUG:Fix some client side transition logicFixed some issues in the logic for determining whether an SKE should beexpected or not In particular only allow an SKE for RSA if its export andthe key size is not allowed Also fix the ephemeral ciphersuite checks andadd in a missing call to ssl3_check_cert_and_algorithm
NOT BUG:Minor documentation tweakUpdate the return type for SSL_state in the documentation
NOT BUG:Update CHANGESUpdate the CHANGES file for the state machine rewrite

NOT BUG:Remove some unused variablesThe next_state variable is no longer needed in the new state machine
NOT BUG:Add a state machine READMEAdd some documentation on the thinking behind the state machine
NOT BUG:make update
NOT BUG:More state machine reorgMove some function definitions around within the state machine to make surethey are in the correct files Also create a statem_loclh header for stuffentirely local to the state machine code and move various definitions intoit
NOT BUG:Reorganise state machine filesPull out the state machine into a separate sub directory Also moved somefunctions which were nothing to do with the state machine but were in statemachine files Pulled all the SSL_METHOD definitions into one placemostof those files had very little left in them any more
NOT BUG:Remove ssl_get_message from ssl_method_stssl_get_message is no longer used so it should be removed fromssl_method_st
NOT BUG:Move PACKET creation into the state machinePreviously each message specific process function would create its ownPACKET structure Rather than duplicate all of this code lots of times weshould create it in the state machine itself
NOT BUG:Remove the SSL state variableThe SSL structure contained a "state" variable that kept track of the statemachine in the old code The new state machine does not use this so it canbe removed
NOT BUG:Remove the type variableThe SSL structure contained a "type" variable that was set to eitherSSL_ST_ACCEPT or SSL_ST_CONNECT depending on whether we are the server orthe client This duplicates the capability of the "server" variable and wasactually rarely used
NOT BUG:Convert DTLSv1_listen to use new state machine codeThe DTLSv1_listen code set the state value explicitly to move into initChange to use state_set_in_init instead
NOT BUG:Redefine old state valuessslh and ssl3h have a number of defines for the various states in the oldstate machine code Since this is public API it is not desirable to justremove them Instead redefine them to the closest equivalent state in thenew state machine code If an application calls SSL_state then the returnvalue can still be compared against these old values if necessary Howevernot all values have an equivalent state in the new code, so these are justredefined to a dummy value
NOT BUG:Remove redundant codeClean up and remove lots of code that is now no longer needed due to themove to the new state machine
NOT BUG:Move server side DTLS to new state machineImplement all of the necessary changes to make DTLS on the server workwith the new state machine code

NOT BUG:Delete unused functionsRemove all the functions and dead code that is now no longer required asa result of the DTLS client move into the new state machine code
NOT BUG:Implement DTLS client move to new state machineMove all DTLS client side processing into the new state machine code Asubsequent commit will clean up the old dead code
NOT BUG:dtls_get_message changes for state machine moveCreate a dtls_get_message function similar to the old dtls1_get_message butin the format required for the new state machine code The old function willeventually be deleted in later commits
NOT BUG:Client TLS state machine rewrite cleanupRemove redundant code following moving client side TLS handling to the newstate machine implementation
NOT BUG:Implement Client TLS state machineThis swaps the implementation of the client TLS state machine to use thenew state machine code instead
NOT BUG:Split client message reading and writing functionsThe new state machine code will split up the reading and writing ofhanshake messages into discrete phases In order to facilitate that theexisting "get" type functions will be split into two halves: one to getthe message and one to process it The "send" type functions will also haveall work relating to constructing the message split out into a separatefunction just for that For some functions there will also be separatepre and post "work" phases to prepare or update state
NOT BUG:Add initial state machine rewrite codeThis is the first drop of the new state machine codeThe rewrite has the following objectives: Remove duplication of state code between client and server Remove duplication of state code between TLS and DTLS Simplify transitions and bring the logic together in a single locationso that it is easier to validate Remove duplication of code between each of the message handling functions Receive a message first and then work out whether that is a validtransition  not the other way around the other way causes lots of issueswhere we are expecting one type of message next but actually get somethingelse Separate message flow state from handshake state in order to betterunderstand each message flow state  when to flush buffers; handling restarts in theevent of NBIO events; handling the common flow of steps for reading amessage and the common flow of steps for writing a message etc handshake state  what handshake message are we working on now Control complexity: only the state machine can change state: keep allthe state changes local to a fileThis builds on previous state machine related work: Surface CCS processing in the state machine Version negotiation rewrite
NOT BUG:Split ssl3_get_messageThe function ssl3_get_message gets a whole message from the underlying bioand returns it to the state machine code The new state machine code willsplit this into two discrete steps: get the message header and get themessage body This commit splits the existing function into these twosub steps to facilitate the state machine implementation

NOT BUG:Only include SRP headers when OPENSSL_NO_SRP is undefined[fixes github issue 447]
NOT BUG:Make Configure die when unsupported options are given
NOT BUG:Add an explicit list of options that can be disabled, enabled, Configure has, so far, had no control at all of which 'no' options itcan be given  This means that, for example, someone could configurewith something absurd like 'nostack' and then watch the build crumbleto dust  or file a bug reportThis introduces some sanity into the possible choicesThe added list comes from looking for the explicit ones used inConfigure, and from grepping after OPENSSL_NO_ in all source files
NOT BUG:make update
NOT BUG:Don't forget to load the CT error strings
NOT BUG:Handle CT error macros separatelyBecause the default error macro generator assumes the header file witherror macros is in include/openssl and therefore generates a C filewith error texts that include <openssl/{name}h>, we need to generatethe error macros and texts for CT separately, since the CT moduledoesn't follow the default criteria
NOT BUG:Don't use SSLv23_server_method in an exampleThe function SSLv23_server_method is an old name New code should useTLS_server_method instead Therefore don't use SSLv23_server_method inan example in the docs

NOT BUG:Don't treat a bare OCTETSTRING as DigestInfo in int_rsa_verifyThe function int_rsa_verify is an internal function used for verifying anRSA signature It takes an argument |dtype| which indicates the digest typethat was used Dependant on that digest type the processing of thesignature data will vary In particular if |dtype  NID_mdc2| and thesignature data is a bare OCTETSTRING then it is treated differently to thedefault case where the signature data is treated as a DigestInfo X509_SIGDue to a missing "else" keyword the logic actually correctly processes theOCTETSTRING format signature first, and then attempts to continue andprocess it as DigestInfo This will invariably fail because we already knowthat it is a bare OCTETSTRINGThis failure doesn't actualy make a real difference because it ends up atthe |err| label regardless and still returns a "success" result This patchjust cleans things up to make it look a bit more saneRT4076

NOT BUG:Remove remaining old listen codeThe old implementation of DTLSv1_listen which has now been replaced stillhad a few vestiges scattered throughout the code This commit removes them
NOT BUG:DTLSv1_listen rewriteThe existing implementation of DTLSv1_listen is fundamentally flawed Thisfunction is used in DTLS solutions to listen for new incoming connectionsfrom DTLS clients A client will send an initial ClientHello The serverwill respond with a HelloVerifyRequest containing a unique cookie Theclient the responds with a second ClientHello  which this time contains thecookieOnce the cookie has been verified then DTLSv1_listen returns to user code,which is typically expected to continue the handshake with a call to forexample SSL_acceptWhilst listening for incoming ClientHellos, the underlying BIO is usually inan unconnected state Therefore ClientHellos can come in from any peerThe arrival of the first ClientHello without the cookie, and the second onewith it, could be interspersed with other intervening messages fromdifferent clientsThe whole purpose of this mechanism is as a defence against DoS attacks Theidea is to avoid allocating state on the server until the client hasverified that it is capable of receiving messages at the address it claimsto come from However the existing DTLSv1_listen implementation completelyfails to do this It attempts to superimpose itself on the standard statemachine and reuses all of this code However the standard state machineexpects to operate in a stateful manner with a single client, and this cancause various problemsA second more minor issue is that the return codes from this function arequite confused, with no distinction made between fatal and nonfatal errorsMost user code treats all errors as nonfatal, and simply retries the callto DTLSv1_listenThis commit completely rewrites the implementation of DTLSv1_listen andprovides a stand alone implementation that does not rely on the existingstate machine It also provides more consistent return codes

NOT BUG:Correct jpake testThere actually is a "jpake" feature to check the availability on
NOT BUG:Correct sha testsThese tests were checking for specific sha variants, when they shouldjust check if "sha" is disabled
NOT BUG:Correct whirlpool testIt depended on 'openssl nowp', which always exited with code 0, sothis test would never be performed, and this, I never discovered thatthe program it's supposed to run was misspellt  Furthermore, thefeature to check is 'whirlpool', not 'wp'All corrected
NOT BUG:Finally, remove a possibly disabled featureI have no clue why MD_GHOST94 was checked on, there is noOPENSSL_NO_MD_GHOST94 in sight anywhere
NOT BUG:Add more features that may be disabledHave a look at the directories in crypto/, I found reason to addchecks on CMAC and HMAC  This might be completely irrelevant, but Iprefered covering too much than not enough
NOT BUG:Add more features that may be disabledA grep of OPENSSL_NO_ in the rest of the source tree revealed a fewmore features to checkNOTE: there are some of those macros that I ignore because a check ofthem doesn't seem useful to external apps  This might change later on
NOT BUG:Add more features that may be disabledAfter a grep of OPENSSL_NO_ in apps/c, a few more features that maybe interesting to check the availability of came up

BUG:Remove PACKET_backIt's unused, and the same functionality can be achieved with saving acopy of the struct
NOT BUG:Make sure OPENSSL_cleanse checks for NULLIn master we have the function OPENSSL_clear_freex,y, which immediatelyreturns if x  NULL In <102 this function does not exist so we have todo:OPENSSL_cleansex, y;OPENSSL_freex;However, previously, OPENSSL_cleanse did not check that if x  NULL, sothe real equivalent check would have to be:if x ! NULLOPENSSL_cleansex, y;OPENSSL_freex;It would be easy to get this wrong during cherrypicking to other branchesand therefore, for safety, it is best to just ensure OPENSSL_cleanse alsochecks for NULL
NOT BUG:base64 decode: check for high bitPreviously, the conversion would silently coerce to ASCII Now, we errorout
NOT BUG:RT3757: base64 encoding bugsRewrite EVP_DecodeUpdateIn particular: reject extra trailing padding, and padding in the middleof the content Don't limit line length Add testsPreviously, the behaviour was illdefined, and depended on the positionof the padding within the inputIn addition, this appears to fix a possible twobyte oob read

BUG:Restore SSLerr on PACKET_strndup failure
NOT BUG:RT3992: Make SCT ifdeffableThis code does opencoded division on 64bit quantities and thus whenbuilding with GCC on 32bit platforms will require functions such as__umoddi3 and __udivdi3 from libgccIn constrained environments such as firmware, those functions may notbe available So make it possible to compile out SCT support, which infact in the case of UEFI we don't need anywaySignedoffby: Rich Salz <rsalz@akamaicom>
NOT BUG:Add a simple test for the new rehash command
NOT BUG:Make sure the temporary error log resides in a well defined locationIf a test recipe does something like this:indir "foo$$" > sub {chmod 0500, File::Spec>curdir;okrunapp["something"];}we get a problem, because we were storing the temporary stderr file inthe current directory at all times so while inside the 'indir', wewould attemp to store it in "foo$$"So, change our ways to always store that temporary file in the exactsame location, defined by the environment variable RESULT_D, orfailing that TEST_D, or failing that $TOP/test

NOT BUG:RT3969: Add OPENSSL_SYS_UEFIThis provides support for building in the EDK II reference implementationof UEFI Most UEFI firmware in existence uses OpenSSL for implementingthe core cryptographic functionality needed for Secure BootThis has always previously been handled with external patches to OpenSSLbut we are now making a concerted effort to eliminate thoseIn this mode, we don't actually use the OpenSSL makefiles; we processthe MINFO file generated by 'make files' and incorporate it into theEDK2 build systemSince EDK II builds for various targets with varying word size and weneed to have a single prepackaged configuration, we deliberately don'thardcode the setting of SIXTY_FOUR_BIT vs THIRTY_TWO_BIT inopensslconfh We bypass that for OPENSSL_SYS_UEFI and allow EDK IIitself to set those, depending on the architectureFor x86_64, EDK II sets SIXTY_FOUR_BIT and thus uses 'long long' for the64bit type, even when building with GCC where 'long' is also 64bit Wedo this because the Microsoft toolchain has 32bit 'long'Signedoffby: Rich Salz <rsalz@akamaicom>

NOT BUG:Adjust the general fillcolumn in doc/dirlocalsexampleelHaving a general fillcolumn of 78 may look nice at first sight, butif the edited text gets indented a bit afterward such as with gitcomments in 'git log', it suddenly turns not so nice on a classic 80columns terminal  A fillcolumn of 70 will serve us better
NOT BUG:Adjust the verify_extra test recipe to its executableThe verify_extra_test was recently changed to take its parameters asarguments instead of having them hardcoded
NOT BUG:GH391: Apple portAlso make internal functions consistently return values, andadd a comment documenting them

NOT BUG:Small fix in OpenSSL::TestBe careful when shifting in a function argument, you end up changingthe caller's value  Instead, when it is an array, make a shallow copyand shift in that instead
BUG:Incorporate recent changes that were originally made in test/testssl
NOT BUG:Add documentation for the new testing framework
NOT BUG:Add a recipe for the new gmdiff test
NOT BUG:Correct test nameSome tests were copied from test_jpake, but the title wasn't changedaccordingly  This might seem like a small thing, but it does affectthe log file name
NOT BUG:Remake test/sslsessionticktestpl into a recipe
NOT BUG:Adapt the libssl test harness testing scripts to new testing frameworkThis involves adding $TOP/util as perl library in test/run_testspl
NOT BUG:Check the validity of MINFOMINFO may be an old file lying around, which might have00check_testexest produce incorrect results  To make sure thisdoesn't happen, check the variable VERSION in it against the samevariable in the top Makefile
NOT BUG:Better method of skipping all the tests in 00check_testexestBefore trying to read MINFO, we have no idea how many to test for, andbecause skip expects to get an exact number somehow, it's better touse 'plan skip_all'
NOT BUG:Remove special x509 test conversionsFollowing the commit from July 2 that removed netscape formated certs,it is no longer necessary to have conversion tests for it
NOT BUG:Add a few missing teststest_clienthellotest_packettest_verify_extratest_secmem
NOT BUG:Push the line buffer filter on the out BIO on VMSVMS files are normally record oriented rather than stream orientedThis means that every write will create a new record, which is seenas a line of its own, regardless of if there was a \n in there or notbntest uses BN_print, which prints out number with more than onewrite, thereby dividing up the numbers in several lines, whichgreatly disturbs the postbntest checks that expect to find a fullformula to calculate on one lineSo, for VMS, we need to push the linebuffer filter on the out BIO
NOT BUG:Rework 00test_checkexest for VMSUnfortunately, a file spec with character range globs interfere withpaths on VMS, and are therefore disabled  Rework this test to collecta list of expected tests and a list of all recipes and compare the twousing grep
NOT BUG:Document OpenSSL::Test and OpenSSL::Test::SimpleFor OpenSSL::Test, it meant rearranging the code to better suite thestructure of the documentation
NOT BUG:Change OpenSSL::Test to be an extension of Test::MoreIt became tedious as well as error prone to have all recipes useTest::More as well as OpenSSL::Test  The easier way is to makeOpenSSL::Test an extension of Test::More, thereby having all versionchecks as well as future checks firmly there  Additionally, thatallows us to extend existing Test::More functions if the need wouldarise
NOT BUG:New feature: STOPTESTWhen the environment variable STOPTEST is defined with any value otherthan the empty string, the test machinery in OpenSSL::Test goes into adifferent mode that will stop all testing at the end of a failing recipe
NOT BUG:Add version numbers on some modules we use
NOT BUG:Have 'make clean' clean away the log files
NOT BUG:Tone down the requirements of a test that will go away00check_testexest was a way for me to check that I didn't forget acompiled test app  The way it worked was to require MINFO to be presentConsidering the need for this test has diminished considerably at thispoint, I might as well tone down the requirement, and have it skip thetest and not fail it if MINFO isn't present
NOT BUG:Remove old testing scripts out of the wayFor now, I'm moving them into Attic/  They will be removed later
NOT BUG:Adapt mk1mfpl and helpers to the new testing frameworkWith the new testing framework, building a test target with mk1mfplbecomes a very simple thing  And especially, no more need to do theamount of hackery in unixpl we didAlso, some tests need a working apps/CApl as well as rehashed certsin certs/demo  So, move the code creating those files so it gets doneregardless, not just in nonmk1mf environments
NOT BUG:Simplify very simple test recipes furtherVery simple test recipes easily become tedious, so they might benefitfrom being made as simple as possible  Therefore, OpenSSL::Test::Simpleis born  It currently provides but one function, simple_test, whichtakes a minimum of two parameters test name and program to run, withthe optional third, being the algorithm to be checked for beforerunning the test itselfAll recipes with that simple thing to do have been rewritten to be asminimal as possible
NOT BUG:Remove test targets from Makefile, have it use run_testsplAlso remove recipes/00check_testalltestst, since it will lack theinformation from the now gone alltests target
NOT BUG:Ignore the log filesThe new test framework produces a lot of log files one for eachtest  Git doesn't need to know
NOT BUG:Add recipes for misc other things we want to testNote that this required a change in constant_time_testc, as it says"ok", which interferes with what Test::Harness expects to see  I hadconstant_time_testc say "success" instead
NOT BUG:Add recipes for the larger protocolsThis covers the certificate authority commands, the cms and smimecommands, OCSP, SSL and TSA
NOT BUG:Add engine and evp test recipes
NOT BUG:Add recipes for tests related to certificatesSome of them make use of recipes/tconversionpl
NOT BUG:Add asymetric cipher test recipesSome of them make use of recipes/tconversionpl
NOT BUG:Add a helper script for key file format conversion testsAs tests are done until now, there are a few scripts that look almost,but not quite the same  tkey, tx509, tcrl, tpkcs7, treq, tsid andprobably a few morerecipes/tconversionspl is a helper script that generalises thefunction of each of those, and can then be used in a general mannerfrom test recipes
NOT BUG:Add the encryption test recipeThis tests all available openssl cipher commands
NOT BUG:Add recipes for individual block ciphers, stream ciphers and digestsThese recipes all correspond to a compiled test program
NOT BUG:Add math tests recipesThe math recipes are among the heavier, but also quite importantFor the BN test, we have previously relied on bc to verify the numbersUnfortunately, bc doesn't exist everywhere, making tests on some platformsrather painful  With the new recipe recipes/10test_bnt, we relyon perl's Math::BigInt and a homegrown simple calculator recipes/bcplthat can do enough to cover for bc
NOT BUG:Groundwork for a perl based testing frameworkThe idea with this perl based testing framework is to make use ofwhat's delivered with perl and exists on all sorts of platformsThe choice came to using Test::More and Test::Harness, as that seemsto be the most widely spread foundation, even if perl is agedThe main runner of the show is run_testspl  As it currently stands,it's designed to run from inside Makefile, but it's absolutelypossible to run it from the command line as well, like so:cd testOPENSSL_SRCDIR perl run_testsplThe tester scripts themselves are stored in the subdirectory recipes/,and initially, we have two such scripts, recipes/00check_testallteststand recipes/00check_testexest  recipes/00check_testalltestst willpick out the dependencies of "alltests" in test/Makefile, and check ifit can find recipes with corresponding names  recipes/00check_testexestdoes something similar, but bases it on existing compiled test binariesThey make it easy to figure out what's to be added, and will beremoved when this effort is finishedIndividual recipes can be run as well, of course, as they are perlscripts in themselves  For example, you can run onlyrecipes/00check_testexest like so:cd testOPENSSL_SRCDIR perl recipes/00check_testexestTo make coding easier, there's a routine library OpenSSL::Test, whichis reachable in a perl script like so:use lib 'testlib';use OpenSSL::Test;

NOT BUG:Fixup merge conflicts in util/libeaynum
NOT BUG:Change the treatment of stdin and stdout to allow binary dataIf the output to stdout or the input from stdin is meant to be binary,it's deeply unsetting to get the occasional LF converted to CRLF orthe other way around  If someone happens to forget to redirect stdinor stdout, they will get gibberish anyway, line ending conversion willnot change thatTherefore, let's not have dup_bio_ decide unilaterally what mode theBIO derived from stdin and stdout, and rather let the app decide bydeclaring the intended format
BUG:dup_bio_ and bio_open_ are utility functions and belong in appsc
NOT BUG:Remove warning about use of uninitialised variable
NOT BUG:Have binary mode when the format is binary, not the other way aroundFixing a small mixup
NOT BUG:Have the test executables output in text modeThe test executables use standard output and standard error for text output,so let's open the corresponding BIOs in text mode
NOT BUG:Change the way apps open their input and output filesThe different apps had the liberty to decide whether they would open theirinput and output files in binary mode or not, which could be confusing iftwo different apps were handling the same type of file in different waysThe solution is to centralise the decision of low level file organisation,and that the apps would use a selection of formats to state the intent ofthe file
NOT BUG:Make the handling of output and input formats consistentMost of all, we needed to sort out which ones are binary and whichones are text, and make sure they are treated accordingly andconsistently so
NOT BUG:Make the verify_extra test location agnosticDepending on platform, verify_extra_test may fail because it relies ontest/ being the current working directory  Make it get all the requiredfiles on the command line instead to solve that issue

NOT BUG:Fix "make test" seg fault with SCTP enabledWhen config'd with "sctp" running "make test" causes a seg fault This isactually due to the way ssltest works  it dives under the covers and freesup BIOs manually and so some BIOs are NULL when the SCTP code does notexpect it The simplest fix is just to add some sanity checks to make surethe BIOs aren't NULL before we use themThis problem occurs in master and 102 The fix has also been applied to101 to keep the code in sync

NOT BUG:Add a libssl test harnessThis commit provides a set of perl modules that support the testing oflibssl The test harness operates as a maninthemiddle proxy betweens_server and s_client Both s_server and s_client must be started using the"testmode" option which loads the new OSSLTEST engineThe test harness enables scripts to be written that can examine the packetssent during a handshake, as well as potentially modifying them so thatotherwise illegal handshake messages can be sent
NOT BUG:Add OSSLTest EngineThis engine is for testing purposes only It provides crippled cryptoimplementations and therefore must not be used in any instance wheresecurity is requiredThis will be used by the forthcoming libssl test harness which will operateas a maninthemiddle proxy The test harness will be able to modifyTLS packets and read their contents By using this test engine packets arenot encrypted and MAC codes always verify

NOT BUG:Move DTLS CCS processing into the state machineContinuing on from the previous commit this moves the processing of DTLSCCS messages out of the record layer and into the state machine
NOT BUG:Move TLS CCS processing into the state machineThe handling of incoming CCS records is a little strange Since CCS is nota handshake message it is handled differently to normal handshake messagesUnfortunately whilst technically it is not a handhshake message the realityis that it must be processed in accordance with the state of the handshakeCurrently CCS records are processed entirely within the record layer Inorder to ensure that it is handled in accordance with the handshake statea flag is used to indicate that it is an acceptable time to receive a CCSPreviously this flag did not exist see CVE20140224, but the flag should only really be considered a workaround for the problem that CCS is not visible to the state machineOutgoing CCS messages are already handled within the state machineThis patch makes CCS visible to the TLS state machine A separate commitwill handle DTLS

NOT BUG:Remove support for SSL3_FLAGS_DELAY_CLIENT_FINISHEDThis flag was not set anywhere within the codebase only read It couldonly be set by an app reaching directly into s>s3>flags and setting itdirectly However that method became impossible when libssl was opaquifiedEven in 102/101 if an app set the flag directly it is only relevant tossl3_connect, which calls SSL_clear during initialisation that clearsany flag settings Therefore it could take effect if the app set the flagafter the handshake has started but before it completed It seems quiteunlikely that any apps really do this especially as it is completelyundocumentedThe purpose of the flag is suppress flushing of the write bio on the clientside at the end of the handshake after the client has written the Finishedmessage whilst resuming a session This enables the client to sendapplication data as part of the same flight as the Finished messageThis flag also controls the setting of a second flag SSL3_FLAGS_POP_BUFFERThere is an interesting comment in the code about this second flag in theimplementation of ssl3_write:/ This is an experimental flag that sends the last handshake message in the same packet as the first use data  used to see if it helps the TCP protocol during sessionid reuse /It seems the experiment did not work because as far as I can tell nothingis using this code The above comment has been in the code since SSLeayThis commit removes support for SSL3_FLAGS_DELAY_CLIENT_FINISHED, as wellas the associated SSL3_FLAGS_POP_BUFFER

NOT BUG:Reject calls to X509_verify_cert that have not been reinitialisedThe function X509_verify_cert checks the value of |ctx>chain| at thebeginning, and if it is NULL then it initialises it, along with the valueof ctx>untrusted The normal way to use X509_verify_cert is to firstcall X509_STORE_CTX_init; then set up various parameters etc; then callX509_verify_cert; then check the results; and finally callX509_STORE_CTX_cleanup The initial call to X509_STORE_CTX_init sets|ctx>chain| to NULL The only place in the OpenSSL codebase  where|ctx>chain| is set to anything other than a non NULL value is inX509_verify_cert itself Therefore the only ways that |ctx>chain| could benon NULL on entry to X509_verify_cert is if one of the following occurs:1 An application calls X509_verify_cert twice without reinitialisingin between2 An application reaches inside the X509_STORE_CTX structure and changesthe value of |ctx>chain| directlyWith regards to the second of these, we should discount this  it shouldnot be supported to allow thisWith regards to the first of these, the documentation is not exactlycrystal clear, but the implication is that you must callX509_STORE_CTX_init before each call to X509_verify_cert If you failto do this then, at best, the results would be undefinedCalling X509_verify_cert with |ctx>chain| set to a non NULL value islikely to have unexpected results, and could be dangerous This commitchanges the behaviour of X509_verify_cert so that it causes an error if|ctx>chain| is anything other than NULL because this indicates that wehave not been initialised properly It also clarifies the associateddocumentation This is a follow up commit to CVE20151793

NOT BUG:Remove export static DH ciphersuitesRemove support for the two export grade static DH ciphersuites These twociphersuites were newly added along with a number of other static DHciphersuites to 102 However the two export ones have never workedsince they were introduced It seems strange in any case to be adding newexport ciphersuites, and given "logjam" it also does not seem correct tofix them

NOT BUG:RT266: Add HTTP proxy/CONNECT to s_clientSignedoffby: Rich Salz <rsalz@opensslorg>
NOT BUG:Fix the update target and remove duplicate file updatesWe had updates of certain header files in both Makefileorg and theMakefile in the directory the header file lived in  This is errorprone and also sometimes generates slightly different results usuallyjust a comment that differs depending on which way the update wasdoneThis removes the file update targets from the top level Makefile, addsan update: target in all Makefiles and has it depend on the depend: orlocal_depend: targets, whichever is appropriate, so we don't get adouble run through the whole file tree

NOT BUG:Fix a memory leak in compressionThe function RECORD_LAYER_clear is supposed to clear the contents of theRECORD_LAYER structure, but retain certain data such as buffers that areallocated Unfortunately one buffer for compression got missed and wasinadvertently being wiped, thus causing a memory leakIn part this is due to the fact that RECORD_LAYER_clear was reachinginside SSL3_BUFFERs and SSL3_RECORDs, which it really shouldn't So, I'verewritten it to only clear the data it knows about, and to defer clearingof SSL3_RECORD and SSL3_BUFFER structures to SSL_RECORD_clear and thenew function SSL3_BUFFER_clear

NOT BUG:Client side version negotiation rewriteContinuing from the previous commit this changes the way we do client sideversion negotiation Similarly all of the s23 "up front" state machine codehas been avoided and again things now work much the same way as they alreadydid for DTLS, ie we just do most of the work in thessl3_get_server_hello function
NOT BUG:Server side version negotiation rewriteThis commit changes the way that we do server side protocol versionnegotiation Previously we had a whole set of code that had an "up front"state machine dedicated to the negotiating the protocol version This addssignificant complexity to the state machine Historically the justificationfor doing this was the support of SSLv2 which works quite differently toSSLv3+ However, we have now removed support for SSLv2 so there is littlereason to maintain this complexityThe one slight difficulty is that, although we no longer support SSLv2, wedo still support an SSLv3+ ClientHello in an SSLv2 backward compatibleClientHello format This is generally only used by legacy clients Thiscommit adds support within the SSLv3 code for these legacy formatClientHellosServer side version negotiation now works in much the same was as DTLS,ie we introduce the concept of TLS_ANY_VERSION If s>version is set tothat then when a ClientHello is received it will work out the mostappropriate version to respond with Also, SSLv23_method andSSLv23_server_method have been replaced with TLS_method andTLS_server_method respectively The old SSLv23 names still exist asmacros pointing at the new name, although they are deprecatedSubsequent commits will look at client side version negotiation, as well ofremoval of the old s23 code

NOT BUG:Move definition of INTxx_MIN et al to internal headerHaving the INTxx_MIN et al macros defined in a public header isunnecessary and risky  Also, it wasn't done for all platforms thatmight need itSo we move those numbers to an internal header file, do the mathourselves and make sure to account for the integer representations weknow ofThis introduces include/internal, which is unproblematic since wealready use I$TOP/include everywhere  This directory is differentfrom crypto/include/internal, as the former is more general internalheaders for all of OpenSSL, while the latter is for libcrypto only
NOT BUG:use unit64_t for CPUID and timestamp code

NOT BUG:Remove Kerberos support from appsRemove Kerberos related options from the apps to prepare for thesubsequent commits which will remove libcrypto and libssl support forKerberos
NOT BUG:Don't allow a CCS when expecting a CertificateVerifyCurrently we set change_cipher_spec_ok to 1 before callingssl3_get_cert_verify This is because this message is optional and if itis not sent then the next thing we would expect to get is the CCS However,although it is optional, we do actually know whether we should be receivingone in advance If we have received a client cert then we should expecta CertificateVerify message By the time we get to this point we willalready have bombed out if we didn't get a Certificate when we should havedone, so it is safe just to check whether |peer| is NULL or not If it iswe won't get a CertificateVerify, otherwise we will Therefore we shouldchange the logic so that we only attempt to get the CertificateVerify ifwe are expecting one, and not allow a CCS in this scenarioWhilst this is good practice for TLS it is even more important for DTLSIn DTLS messages can be lost Therefore we may be in a situation where aCertificateVerify message does not arrive even though one was sent In thatcase the next message the server will receive will be the CCS This couldalso happen if messages get reordered inflight In DTLS if|change_cipher_spec_ok| is not set and a CCS is received it is ignoredHowever if |change_cipher_spec_ok| is set then a CCS arrival willimmediately move the server into the next epoch Any messages arriving forthe previous epoch will be ignored This means that, in this scenario, thehandshake can never complete The client will attempt to retransmitmissing messages, but the server will ignore them because they are the wrongepoch The server meanwhile will still be waiting for the CertificateVerifywhich is never going to arriveRT2958

BUG:Fix cipherlist order
NOT BUG:Make COMP_CTX and COMP_METHOD opaqueSince COMP_METHOD is now defined in comp_lclh, it is nolonger possible to create new TLS compression methods withoutusing the OpenSSL source  Only ZLIB is supported by defaultAlso, since the types are opaque, ifdef guards to use "char "instead of the real type aren't necessaryThe changes are actually minor  Adding missing copyright to somefiles makes the diff misleadingly big

NOT BUG:Make sig_app, sigx_app static
NOT BUG:Make CAserial a type 's' optionThe file name given to CAserial might not exist yet  TheCAcreateserial option decides if this is ok or notPrevious to this change, CAserial was a type '<' option, and in thatcase, the existence of the file given as argument is tested quiteearly, and is a failure if it doesn't  With the type 's' option, theargument is just a string that the application can do whatever itwants with
NOT BUG:Add a CAserial argument for signing the user cert requestThis is just to make sure that option is tested on a Unix build  Thisoption is already present in ms/testssbat, so it's an easy steal
NOT BUG:SSL_CONF table reorganisationAdd command line switch entries to table and return SSL_CONF_TYPE_NONE forthem in SSL_CONF_cmd_value_typeUpdate docs
NOT BUG:Initialize potentially uninitialized local variablesCompiling OpenSSL code with MSVC and /W4 results in a number of warningsOne category of warnings is particularly interesting  C4701 potentiallyuninitialized local variable 'name' used This warning pretty much meansthat there's a code path which results in uninitialized variables being usedor returned Depending on compiler, its options, OS, values in registersand/or stack, the results can be nondeterministic Cases like this are veryhard to debug so it's rational to fix these issuesThis patch contains a set of trivial fixes for all the C4701 warnings justinitializing variables to 0 or NULL or appropriate error code to make surethat deterministic values will be returned from all the execution pathsRT3835Signedoffby: Matt Caswell <matt@opensslorg>Matt's note: All of these appear to be bogus warnings, ie there isn'tactually a code path where an unitialised variable could be used  its justthat the compiler hasn't been able to figure that out from the logic Sothis commit is just about silencing spurious warnings

NOT BUG:Fix buffer overrun in RSA signingThe problem occurs in EVP_PKEY_sign when using RSA with X931 paddingIt is only triggered if the RSA key size is smaller than the digest lengthSo with SHA512 you can trigger the overflow with anything less than an RSA512 bit key I managed to trigger a 62 byte overflow when using a 16 bit RSAkey This wasn't sufficient to cause a crash, although your mileage mayvaryIn practice RSA keys of this length are never used and X931 padding is veryrare Even if someone did use an excessively short RSA key, the chances ofthem combining that with a longer digest and X931 padding is verysmall For these reasons I do not believe there is a security implication tothis Thanks to Kevin Wojtysiak Int3 Solutions and Paramjot Oberoi Int3Solutions for reporting this issue

NOT BUG:Add sanity check in ssl3_cbc_digest_recordFor SSLv3 the code assumes that |header_length| > |md_block_size| Whilstthis is true for all SSLv3 ciphersuites, this fact is far from obvious bylooking at the code If this were not the case then an integer overflowwould occur, leading to a subsequent buffer overflow Therefore I haveadded an explicit sanity check to ensure header_length is always validThanks to Kevin Wojtysiak Int3 Solutions and Paramjot Oberoi Int3Solutions for reporting this issue
NOT BUG:Clarify logic in BIO_printf functionsThe static function dynamically allocates an output buffer if the outputgrows larger than the static buffer that is normally used The originallogic implied that |currlen| could be greater than |maxlen| which isincorrect and if so would cause a buffer overrun Also the originallogic would call OPENSSL_malloc to create a dynamic buffer equal to thesize of the static buffer, and then immediately call OPENSSL_realloc tomake it bigger, rather than just creating a buffer than was big enough inthe first place Thanks to Kevin Wojtysiak Int3 Solutions and ParamjotOberoi Int3 Solutions for reporting this issue

NOT BUG:Deprecate RAND_pseudo_bytesThe justification for RAND_pseudo_bytes is somewhat dubious, and the realityis that it is frequently being misused RAND_bytes and RAND_pseudo_bytes inthe default implementation both end up calling ssleay_rand_bytes Both mayreturn 1 in an error condition If there is insufficient entropy thenboth will return 0, but RAND_bytes will additionally add an error to theerror queue They both return 1 on successTherefore the fundamental difference between the two is that one will add anerror to the error queue with insufficient entory whilst the other will notFrequently there are constructions of this form:ifRAND_pseudo_bytes < 1goto err;In the above form insufficient entropy is treated as an error anyway, soRAND_bytes is probably the better form to useThis form is also seen:if!RAND_pseudo_bytesgoto err;This is technically not correct at all since a 1 return value isincorrectly handled  but this form will also treat insufficient entropy asan errorWithin libssl it is required that you have correctly seeded your entropypool and so there seems little benefit in using RAND_pseudo_bytesSimilarly in libcrypto many operations also require a correctly seededentropy pool and so in most interesting cases you would be better offusing RAND_bytes anyway There is a significant risk of RAND_pseudo_bytesbeing incorrectly used in scenarios where security can be compromised byinsufficient entropyIf you are not using the default implementation, then most engines use thesame function to implement RAND_bytes and RAND_pseudo_bytes in any caseGiven its misuse, limited benefit, and potential to compromise security,RAND_pseudo_bytes has been deprecated

NOT BUG:Add ticket length before buffering DTLS messageIn ssl3_send_new_session_ticket the message to be sent is constructed Weskip adding the length of the session ticket initially, then callssl_set_handshake_header, and finally go back and add in the length of theticket Unfortunately, in DTLS, ssl_set_handshake_header also has the sideeffect of buffering the message for subsequent retransmission if requiredBy adding the ticket length after the call to ssl_set_handshake_header themessage that is buffered is incomplete, causing an invalid message to besent on retransmission
NOT BUG:Ensure last_write_sequence is saved in DTLS12In DTLS, immediately prior to epoch change, the write_sequence is supposedto be stored in s>d1>last_write_sequence The write_sequence is then resetback to 00000000 In the event of retransmits of records from the previousepoch, the last_write_sequence is restored This commit fixes a bug inDTLS12 where the write_sequence was being reset before last_write_sequencewas saved, and therefore retransmits are sent with incorrect sequencenumbers

NOT BUG:Fix Seg fault in DTLSv1_listenThe DTLSv1_listen function is intended to be stateless and processesthe initial ClientHello from many peers It is common for user code toloop over the call to DTLSv1_listen until a valid ClientHello is receivedwith an associated cookie A defect in the implementation of DTLSv1_listenmeans that state is preserved in the SSL object from one invokation to thenext that can lead to a segmentation fault Erorrs processing the initialClientHello can trigger this scenario An example of such an error couldbe that a DTLS10 only client is attempting to connect to a DTLS12 onlyserverCVE20150207
NOT BUG:Multiblock corrupted pointer fixOpenSSL 102 introduced the "multiblock" performance improvement Thisfeature only applies on 64 bit x86 architecture platforms that support AESNI instructions A defect in the implementation of "multiblock" can causeOpenSSL's internal write buffer to become incorrectly set to NULL whenusing nonblocking IO Typically, when the user application is using asocket BIO for writing, this will only result in a failed connectionHowever if some other BIO is used then it is likely that a segmentationfault will be triggered, thus enabling a potential DoS attackCVE20150290
NOT BUG:Configure: fold related configurations more aggressively and cleanup

NOT BUG:Fix probable_prime over large shiftIn the probable_prime function we behave slightly different if the numberof bits we are interested in is < BN_BITS2 the num of bits in a BN_ULONGAs part of the calculation we work out a size_limit as follows:size_limit  BN_ULONG1 << bits  BN_get_wordrnd  1;There is a problem though if bits  BN_BITS2 Shifting by that much causesundefined behaviour I did some tests On my system BN_BITS2  64 So Iset bits to 64 and calculated the result of:BN_ULONG1 << bitsI was expecting to get the result 0 I actually got 1! Strangely thisBN_ULONG0 << BN_BITS2does equal 0! This means that, on my system at least, size_limit will beoff by 1 when bits  BN_BITS2This commit fixes the behaviour so that we always get consistent results
NOT BUG:Fix unintended sign extensionThe function CRYPTO_128_unwrap_pad uses an 8 byte AIV Alternative InitialValue The least significant 4 bytes of this is placed into the localvariable |ptext_len| This is done as follows:ptext_len  aiv[4] << 24 | aiv[5] << 16 | aiv[6] << 8 | aiv[7];aiv[4] is an unsigned char, but aiv[4] << 24 is promoted to a signedint  therefore we could end up shifting into the sign bit and end up witha negative value |ptext_len| is a size_t typically 64bits If theresult of the shifts is negative then the upper bits of |ptext_len| willall be 1This commit fixes the issue by explicitly casting to an unsigned int

NOT BUG:Configuration cleanup: personal configsMove obviously personal configurations to personal filesNote: those files should really not be in the main repo at all
NOT BUG:Updated TABLE
NOT BUG:Find debug targets that can be combined with their nondebug counterparts and do so
NOT BUG:Change all the main configurations to the new formatAs part of this, remove some levitte examples that never were relevant
NOT BUG:Rethink templatesBecause base templates express inheritance of values, the attribute isrenamed to 'inherit_from', and texts about this talk about 'inheritances'rather than base templatesAs they were previously implemented, base templates that were listedtogether would override one another, the first one acting as defaults forthe next and so onHowever, it was pointed out that a strength of inheritance would be tobase configurations on several templates  for example one for CPU, onefor operating system and one for compiler  and that requires a differentway of combining those templates  With this change, inherited valuesfrom several inheritances are concatenated by default keep on readingAlso, instring templates with the doublecurly syntax are removed,replaced with the possibility to have a configuration value be a coderefie a 'sub { / your code goes here / }' that gets the list of valuesfrom all inheritances as the list @_  The result of executing such acoderef on a list of values is assumed to become a string  ANY OTHERFORM OF VALUE WILL CURRENTLY BREAKAs a matter of fact, an attribute in the current config with no value isassumed to have this coderef as value:sub { join' ', @_ }While we're at it, rename debug[cl]flags to debug_[cl]flags andnodebug[cl]flags to release_[cl]flags
NOT BUG:Provide a few examples by converting my own strings to hash table configurations
NOT BUG:Add base template processingBase templates are templates that are used to inherit from  They canloosely be compared with parent class inheritance in object orientationThey can be used for the same purpose as the variables with multifieldstrings are used in oldstyle string configurationsBase templates are declared with the base_templates configurationattribute, like so:"example_target" > {base_templates > [ "x86_asm",  ]}Note: The value of base_templates MUST be an array reference an arrayenclosed in square bracketsAny configuration target can be used as a base template by another  Itis also possible to have a target that's a pure template and not meant tobe used directly as a configuration target  Such a target is marked withthe template configuration attribute, like so:"example_template" > {template > 1,cc > "mycc",},As part of this commit, all variables with multifield strings have beentranslated to pure templates  The variables currently remain since wecan't expect people to shift to hash table configurations immediately
NOT BUG:Add template reference processingTemplate references are words with double brackets, and refer to thesame field in the target pointed at the the double bracketed wordFor example, if a target's configuration has the following entry:'cflags' > 'DFOO {{x86_debug}}' then {{x86_debug}} will be replaced with the 'cflags' value fromtarget 'x86_debug'Note: template references are resolved recursively, and circularreferences are not allowed
NOT BUG:Rewrite Configure to handle the target values as hash tablesThe reasoning is that configuration strings are hard to read and errorprone, and that a better way would be for them to be key > value hashesConfigure is made to be able to handle target configuration values as astring as well as a hash  It also does the best it can to combine a"debugfoo" target with a "foo" target, given that they are similarexcept for the cflags and lflags values  The latter are spliced intooptions that are common for "debugfoo" and "foo", options that existonly with "debugfoo" and options that exist only with "foo", and makethem into combinable attributes that holds common cflags, extra cflagsfor debuggin and extra cflags for nondebugging configurationsThe next step is to make it possible to have template configurations

NOT BUG:Move Configurations out of the way and rename themConfigure would load the glob "Configurations"  The problem withthis is that it also loads all kinds of backups of thoseconfigurations that some editors do, like emacs' classic'Configurations~'  The solution is to give them an extension, such as'conf', and make sure to end the glob with thatAlso, because 'Configurationsconf' makes for a silly name, andbecause a possibly large number of configurations will become clutter,move them to a subdirectory 'Configurations/', and rename them tosomething more expressive, as well as something that sets up some formof sorting order  Thus:Configurations	>	Configurations/10mainconfConfigurationsteam	>	Configurations/90teamconfFinally, make sure that Configure sorts the list of files that 'glob'produces, and adapt Makefileorg

NOT BUG:Add extms support to master key generationUpdate master secret calculation to support extended master secretTLS 12 client authentication adds a complication because we need tocache the handshake messages This is simpllified however becausethe point at which the handshake hashes are calculated for extendedmaster secret is identical to that required for TLS 12 clientauthentication immediately after client key exchange which is alsoimmediately before certificate verify

NOT BUG:Rewrite ssl3_send_client_key_exchange to support extmsRewrite ssl3_send_client_key_exchange to retain the premaster secretinstead of using it immediatelyThis is needed because the premaster secret is used after the client keyexchange message has been sent to compute the extended master secret

NOT BUG:Update changes to indicate that SSLv2 support has been removed
NOT BUG:Remove incorrect code inadvertently introduced through commit 59669b6ab
BUG:Remove SSLv2 supportThe only support for SSLv2 left is receiving a SSLv2 compatible client hello
NOT BUG:New location on website for binaries
NOT BUG:Remove "if 0" code
NOT BUG:Only use the fallback mtu after 2 unsuccessful retransmissions if it is lessthan the mtu we are already using
NOT BUG:Updates to s_client and s_server to remove the constant 28 for IPv4 headerand UDP header when setting an mtu This constant is not always correct egif using IPv6 Use the new DTLS_CTRL functions instead
NOT BUG:If we really get a situation where the underlying mtu is less than the minimumwe will support then dtls1_do_write can go into an infinite loop This commitfixes that
NOT BUG:Fix dtls_query_mtu so that it will always either complete with an mtu that isat least the minimum or it will failThere were some instances in dtls1_query_mtu where the final mtu can end upbeing less than the minimum, ie where the user has set an mtu manually Thisshouldn't be allowed Also remove dtls1_guess_mtu that, despite havinglogic for guessing an mtu, was actually only ever used to work out the minimummtu to use
NOT BUG:Remove instances in libssl of the constant 28 for size of IPv4 header + UDPand instead use the value provided by the underlying BIO Also provide somenew DTLS_CTRLs so that the library user can set the mtu without needing toknow this constant These new DTLS_CTRLs provide the capability to set thelink level mtu to be used ie including this IP/UDP overhead The previousDTLS_CTRLs required the library user to subtract this overhead first
NOT BUG:There are a number of instances throughout the code where the constant 28 isused with no explanation Some of this was introduced as part of RT1929 Thevalue 28 is the length of the IP header 20 bytes plus the UDP header 8bytes However use of this constant is incorrect because there may beinstances where a different value is needed, eg an IPv4 header is 20 bytesbut an IPv6 header is 40 Similarly you may not be using UDP eg SCTPThis commit introduces a new BIO_CTRL that provides the value to be used forthis mtu "overhead" It will be used by subsequent commits
NOT BUG:The first call to query the mtu in dtls1_do_write correctly checks that themtu that we have received is not less than the minimum If its less it uses theminimum instead The second call to query the mtu does not do that, butinstead uses whatever comes back We have seen an instance in RT3592 where wehave got an unreasonably small mtu come back This commit makes both querychecks consistent
NOT BUG:The SSL_OP_NO_QUERY_MTU option is supposed to stop the mtu from beingautomatically updated, and we should use the one provided insteadUnfortunately there are a couple of locations where this is not respected
NOT BUG:Verify that we have a sensible message len and fail if notRT3592 provides an instance where the OPENSSL_assert that this commitreplaces can be hit I was able to recreate this issue by forcing theunderlying BIO to misbehave and come back with very small mtu values Thishappens the second time around the while loop after we have detected that theMTU has been exceeded following the call to dtls1_write_bytes
NOT BUG:Use the SSLv23 method by defaultIf SSLv2 and SSLv3 are both disabled we still support SSL/TLS
NOT BUG:Remove all cvsignore files
NOT BUG:Check for FindNextFile when defining it rather than FindFirstFile
BUG:[PR3597] Advance to the next state variant when reusing messagesPreviously, state variant was not advanced, which resulted in statebeing stuck in the st1 variant usually "_A"This broke certificate callback retry logic when accepting connectionsthat were using SSLv2 ClientHello hence reusing the message, becausetheir state never advanced to SSL3_ST_SR_CLNT_HELLO_C variant requiredfor the retry code pathReported by Yichun Zhang agentzhSignedoffby: Piotr Sikora <piotr@cloudflarecom>

NOT BUG:Clean up CHANGES
NOT BUG:Ensure SSL3_FLAGS_CCS_OK or d1>change_cipher_spec_ok for DTLS is resetonce the ChangeCipherSpec message is received Previously, the server wouldset the flag once at SSL3_ST_SR_CERT_VRFY and again at SSL3_ST_SR_FINISHEDThis would allow a second CCS to arrive and would corrupt the server stateBecause the first CCS would latch the correct keys and subsequent CCSmessages would have to be encrypted, a MitM attacker cannot exploit this,thoughThanks to Joeri de Ruiter for reporting this issue
NOT BUG:Always require an advertised NewSessionTicket messageThe server must send a NewSessionTicket message if it advertised onein the ServerHello, so make a missing ticket message an alertin the clientAn equivalent change was independently made in BoringSSL, see commit6444287806d801b9a45baf1f6f02a0e3a16e144c
NOT BUG:Remove ssl3_check_finishedThe client sends a session ID with the session ticket, and usesthe returned ID to detect resumption, so we do not need to peekat handshake messages: s>hit tells us explicitly if we're resumingAn equivalent change was independently made in BoringSSL, see commit407886f589cf2dbaed82db0a44173036c3bc3317
NOT BUG:Set s>hit when resuming from external preshared secretThe same change was independently made in BoringSSL, see commit9eaeef81fa2d4fd6246dc02b6203fa936a5eaf67
NOT BUG:Reset s>tlsext_ticket_expected in ssl_scan_serverhello_tlsextThis ensures that it's zeroed even if the SSL object is reusedas in ssltestc It also ensures that it applies to DTLS, too
NOT BUG:Fix s_server ssl2 Previously this reported "Error setting EC curve"
NOT BUG:Fix excert logicIf no keyfile has been specified use the certificate file insteadFix typo: we need to check the chain is not NULL, not the chain file
NOT BUG:New option nossl3method which removes SSLv3_methodWhen nossl3 is set only make SSLv3 disabled by default Retain ssl3options for s_client/s_server/ssltestWhen nossl3method is set SSLv3_method is removed and all ssl3optionsWe should document this somewhere, eg wiki, FAQ or manual page
NOT BUG:Only handle RI extension for SSLv3Don't send or parse any extensions other than RI which is neededto handle secure renegotation for SSLv3
NOT BUG:Process signature algorithms before deciding on certificateThe supported signature algorithms extension needs to be processed beforethe certificate to use is decided and before a cipher is selected as theset of shared signature algorithms supported may impact the choice

NOT BUG:psk_client_callback, 128byte id bugFix a bug in handling of 128 byte long PSK identity inpsk_client_callbackOpenSSL supports PSK identities of up to and including 128 bytes inlength PSK identity is obtained via the psk_client_callback,implementors of which are expected to provide a NULLterminatedidentity However, the callback is invoked with only 128 bytes ofstorage thus making it impossible to return a 128 byte long identity andthe required additional NULL byteThis CL fixes the issue by passing in a 129 byte long buffer into thepsk_client_callback As a safety precaution, this CL also zeroes out thebuffer before passing it into the callback, uses strnlen for obtainingthe length of the identity returned by the callback, and aborts thehandshake if the identity without the NULL terminator is longer than128 bytesOriginal patch amended to achieve strnlen in a different way

NOT BUG:Fix DTLS anonymous ECDH denial of serviceCVE20143510
BUG:Fix protocol downgrade bug in case of fragmented packetsCVE20143511
NOT BUG:Remove some duplicate DTLS codeIn a couple of functions, a sequence number would be calculated twiceAdditionally, in |dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message|, we know that|frag_len| < |msg_hdr>msg_len| so the later tests for |frag_len <msg_hdr>msg_len| can be more clearly written as |frag_len !msg_hdr>msg_len|, since that's the only remaining case
NOT BUG:Applying same fix as in dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message A truncated DTLS fragment would cause ok to be clear, but the return value would still be the number of bytes readProblem identified by Emilia Ksper, based on previous issue/patch by AdamLangley
NOT BUG:Fix return code for truncated DTLS fragmentPreviously, a truncated DTLS fragment in|dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message| would cause ok to be cleared, butthe return value would still be the number of bytes read This wouldcause |dtls1_get_message| not to consider it an error and it wouldcontinue processing as normal until the calling function noticed thatok was zeroI can't see an exploit here because |dtls1_get_message| uses|s>init_num| as the length, which will always be zero from what I cansee
NOT BUG:Fix memory leak from zerolength DTLS fragmentsThe |pqueue_insert| function can fail if one attempts to insert aduplicate sequence number When handling a fragment of an out ofsequence message, |dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message| would not call|dtls1_reassemble_fragment| if the fragment's length was zero It wouldthen allocate a fresh fragment and attempt to insert it, but ignore thereturn value, leaking the fragmentThis allows an attacker to exhaust the memory of a DTLS peerFixes CVE20143507
NOT BUG:Fix DTLS handshake message size checksIn |dtls1_reassemble_fragment|, the value of|msg_hdr>frag_off+frag_len| was being checked against the maximumhandshake message size, but then |msg_len| bytes were allocated for thefragment buffer This means that so long as the fragment was within theallowed size, the pending handshake message could consume 16MB + 2MBfor the reassembly bitmap Approx 10 outstanding handshake messagesare allowed, meaning that an attacker could consume ~180MB per DTLSconnectionIn the nonfragmented path in |dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message|, nocheck was appliedFixes CVE20143506Wholly based on patch by Adam Langley with one minor amendment
BUG:Added comment for the frag>reassembly  NULL case as per feedback from Emilia
NOT BUG:Avoid double free when processing DTLS packetsThe |item| variable, in both of these cases, may contain a pointer to a|pitem| structure within |s>d1>buffered_messages| It was being freedin the error case while still being in |buffered_messages| When theerror later caused the |SSL| to be destroyed, the item would be doublefreedThanks to WahTeh Chang for spotting that the fix in 1632ef74 wasinconsistent with the other error paths but correctFixes CVE20143505

NOT BUG:s_client/s_server: support unix domain socketsThe "unix <path>" argument allows s_server and s_client to use a unixdomain socket in the filesystem instead of IPv4 "connect", "port","accept", etc If s_server exits gracefully, such as when "naccept"is used and the requested number of SSL/TLS connections have occurred,then the domain socket file is removed On ctrlC, it is likely thatthe stale socket file will be left over, such that s_server wouldnormally fail to restart with the same arguments For this reason,s_server also supports an "unlink" option, which will clean up anystale socket file before startingIf you have any reason to want encrypted IPC within an O/S instance,this concept might come in handy Otherwise it just demonstrates thatthere is nothing about SSL/TLS that limits it to TCP/IP in any wayThere might also be benchmarking and profiling use in this path, asunix domain sockets are much lower overhead than connecting over localIP addressesSignedoffby: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@opensslorg>

We favour the latter case by punishing the former The init workgets done by each thread that finds the context to be uninitialised, andwe then lock the "set" logic after that work is done  the winningthread's work gets used, the losing threads throw away what they've doneSignedoffby: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@opensslorg>

BUG:DTLS/SCTP struct authchunks BugPR: 2809DTLS/SCTP requires DATA and FORWARDTSN chunks to be protected withSCTPAUTH  It is checked if this has been activated successfully forthe local and remote peer Due to a bug, however, thegauth_number_of_chunks field of the authchunks struct is missing onFreeBSD, and was therefore not considered in the OpenSSL implementationThis patch sets the corresponding pointer for the check correctlywhether or not this bug is presentcherry picked from commit f596e3c491035fe80db5fc0c3ff6b647662b0003
NOT BUG:DTLS/SCTP Finished Auth BugPR: 2808With DTLS/SCTP the SCTP extension SCTPAUTH is used to protect DATA andFORWARDTSN chunks The key for this extension is derived from themaster secret and changed with the next ChangeCipherSpec, whenever a newkey has been negotiated The following Finished then already uses thenew key  Unfortunately, the ChangeCipherSpec and Finished are part ofthe same flight as the ClientKeyExchange, which is necessary for thecomputation of the new secret Hence, these messages are sentimmediately following each other, leaving the server very little time tocompute the new secret and pass it to SCTP before the finished arrivesSo the Finished is likely to be discarded by SCTP and a retransmissionbecomes necessary To prevent this issue, the Finished of the client isstill sent with the old keycherry picked from commit 9fb523adce6fd6015b68da2ca8e4ac4900ac2be2

NOT BUG:Clean up layout
BUG:Add an "xmpphost" option to s_client Many XMPP servers are configured with multiple domains virtual hosts In order to establish successfully the TLS connection you have to specifywhich virtual host you are trying to connect Test this, for example with :: Fail:openssl s_client connect talkgooglecom:5222 starttls xmpp Works:openssl s_client connect talkgooglecom:5222 starttls xmpp xmpphost gmailcom
BUG:Add "xmpp" to the list of supported starttls protocols on s_client manpage

NOT BUG:DTLS revisionRevise DTLS code There was a lot of code duplication in theDTLS code that generates records This makes it harder to maintain andsometimes a TLS update is omitted by accident from the DTLS codeSpecifically almost all of the record generation functions have code likethis:some_pointer  buffer + HANDSHAKE_HEADER_LENGTH; Record creation stuff set_handshake_headerssl, SSL_MT_SOMETHING, message_len;write_handshake_messagessl;Where the "Record creation stuff" is identical between SSL/TLS and DTLS orin some cases has very minor differencesBy adding a few fields to SSL3_ENC to include the header length, some flagsand function pointers for handshake header setting and handshake writing thecode can cope with both casesNote: although this passes "make test" and some simple DTLS tests there maybe some minor differences in the DTLS code that have to be accounted for

NOT BUG:Detect symmetric crypto errors in PKCS7_decryptThanks to Ivan Nestlerode <inestlerode@usibmcom> for reporting this bug
NOT BUG:Configure: I remove adding of D_XPG4_2 D__EXTENSIONS__ in sctp builds forfollowing reasons: it's not the way to engage XPG4v2 mode, defining _XOPEN_SOURCE tovalue less than 500 is see standards5; we need to work out strategy to handle _XOPEN_SOURCE, current statewhen we define eg _XOPEN_SOURCE to 500 in some files is inappropriate; sctp implementation on Solaris is incomplete, in sense that bss_dgramcdoesn't compile, because not all structures are defined, so thatenabling sctp doesn't work anyway;
NOT BUG:seedc: incredibly enough seedc can fail to compile on Solaris with certainflags, because SS is defined after inclusion of <stdlibh>, in <sys/regseth>

NOT BUG:Additional compatibility fix for MDC2 signature formatUpdate RSA EVP_PKEY_METHOD to use the OCTET STRING form of MDC2 signature:this will make all versions of MDC2 signature equivalent
NOT BUG:An incompatibility has always existed between the format used for RSAsignatures and MDC2 using EVP or RSA_sign This has become more apparentwhen the dgst utility in OpenSSL 100 and later switched to using theEVP_DigestSign functions which call RSA_signThis means that the signature format OpenSSL 100 and later used withdgst sign and MDC2 is incompatible with previous versionsAdd detection in RSA_verify so either format worksNote: MDC2 is disabled by default in OpenSSL and very rarely used in practice

NOT BUG:Harmonize Camellia API with version 1x
NOT BUG:Camellia update Quoting camelliac:/ This release balances code size and performance In particular key schedule setup is fully unrolled, because doing so significantly reduces amount of instructions per setup round and code increase is justifiable In block functions on the other hand only inner loops are unrolled, as full unroll gives only nominal performance boost, while code size grows 4 or 7 times Also, unlike previous versions this one "encourages" compiler to keep intermediate variables in registers, which should give better "all round" results, in other words reasonable performance even with not so modern compilers/

NOT BUG:Fix loads of warnings in policy codeI'll remember to try to compile this with warnings enabled next time :
NOT BUG:Fix ASN1 warnings
NOT BUG:Adjust various bignum functions to use BN_CTX for variables instead oflocally initialising their ownNB: I've removed the "BN_clear_free" loops for the exitpaths in some ofthese functions, and that may be a major part of the performanceimprovements we're seeing The "free" part can be removed because we'reusing BN_CTX The "clear" part OTOH can be removed because BN_CTXdestruction automatically performs this task, so performing it insidefunctions that may be called repeatedly is wasteful This is currently safewithin openssl due to the fact that BN_CTX objects are never created forlonger than a single highlevel operation However, that is only becausethere's currently no mechanism in openssl for threadlocal storage Beyondthat, this might be an issue for applications using the bignum API directlyand caching their own BN_CTX objects The solution is to introduce a flagto BN_CTX_start that allows its variables to be automatically sanitisedon release during BN_CTX_end This way any higherlevel function andperhaps the application can specify this flag in its ownBN_CTX_start/BN_CTX_end pair, and this will cause innerloop functionsspecifying the flag to be ignored so that sanitisation is handled only onceback out at the higher level I will be implementing this in the nearfuture
NOT BUG:Replace the BN_CTX implementation with my current work I'm leaving thelittle TODO list in there as well as the debugging code only enabled ifBN_CTX_DEBUG is definedI'd appreciate as much review and testing as can be spared for this I'llcommit some changes to other parts of the bignum code shortly to makebetter use of this implementation no more fixed size limitations Notealso that under identical optimisations, I'm seeing a noticable speedincrease over openssl097  so any feedback to confirm/deny this on othersystems would also be most welcome
NOT BUG:Adds warnings about two curves and fixes the "seed" value for two othercurvesSubmitted by: Nils Larsch
NOT BUG: and this should likewise fix up those RSA implementations that weren'talready built and tested
NOT BUG:By adding a BN_CTX parameter to the 'rsa_mod_exp' callback, private keyoperations no longer require two distinct BN_CTX structures This may putmore "strain" on the current BN_CTX implementation which has a fixed limitto the number of variables it will hold, but so far this limit is nottriggered by any of the tests pass and I will be changing BN_CTX in thenear future to avoid this problem anywayThis also changes the default RSA implementation code to use the BN_CTX infavour of initialising some of its variables locally in each function

Remove some unnecessary "+1"like fudges Sizes should be handledexactly, as enlarging size parameters causes needless bloat and may justmake bugs less likely rather than fixing them: bn_expand macro,bn_expand_internal, and BN_sqr Deprecate bn_dup_expand  it's new since 097, unused, and not thatuseful Remove unnecessary zeroing of unused bytes in bn_expand2 Rewrite BN_set_word  it should be much simpler, the previouscomplexities probably date from old mismatched type issues Add missing bn_check_top macros in bn_wordc Improve some degenerate case handling in BN_[add|sub]_word, addcomments, and avoid a bignum expansion if an overflow isn't possible
NOT BUG:Avoid warnings
NOT BUG:Constify d2i, s2i, c2i and r2i functions and other associatedfunctions and macrosThis change has associated tags: LEVITTE_before_const andLEVITTE_after_const  Those will be removed when this change has beenproperly reviewed
NOT BUG:It was just pointed out to me that it's better to cast to double
NOT BUG:Make sure that the last argument to RAND_add is a float, or somecompilers may complain
NOT BUG:Make sure we use unsigned constants, or come compilers may complain
NOT BUG:Convert openssl code not to assume the deprecated form of BN_zeroRemove certain redundant BN_zero initialisations, because BN_CTX_get,BN_init, [etc] already initialise to zeroCorrect error checking in bn_sqrc, and be less wishywash about how/whythe result's 'top' value is set note also, 'max' is always > 0 at thispoint
NOT BUG:The efforts to eliminate the dualrepresentation of zero and to ensurebignums are passed in and out of functions and APIs in a consistent formhas highlighted that zerovalued bignums don't need any allocated worddata The use of BN_set_word to initialise a bignum to zero causesneedless allocation and gives it a return value that must be checked Thischange converts BN_zero to a selfcontained macro that has noreturn/expression value and does not cause any expansion of bignum dataNote, it would be tempting to rewrite the deprecated version as asuccessvalued comma expression, such as;define BN_zeroa a>top  a>neg  0, 1However, this evaluates 'a' twice and would confuse initialisation loopseg while { BN_zerobn++ }  As such, the deprecated versioncontinues to use BN_set_word
NOT BUG:Document a change I'd already made, and at the same time, correct thechange to work properly; BN_zero should set 'neg' to zero as well as'top' to match the behaviour of BN_new
NOT BUG:IRIX 6x shared build fixupFor reference Note that both cc and gcc support Wl flag, but we can'tuse Wl,[not]all with both drivers, because cc rearranges optionspassed through Wl We can't use Wl,all,libcryptoa,notall with cceither, because it refuses to start with "no input" error

NOT BUG:Minimise the amount of code dependent on BN_DEBUG_RAND In particular,redefine bn_clear_top2max to be a NOP in the nondebugging case, andremove some unnecessary usages in bn_nistcSubmitted by: Nils LarschReviewed by: Geoff Thorpe, Ulf Mller
NOT BUG:More changes coming out of the bignum auditing BN_CTX_get should ideallyreturn a "zero" bignum as BN_new does  so reset 'top' DuringBN_CTX_end, released bignums should be consistent so enforce this indebug builds Also, reduce the number of wasted BN_clear_free calls fromBN_CTX_end typically by 75 or soSubmitted by: Nils LarschReviewed by: Geoff Thorpe, Ulf Mller

NOT BUG:Incremental cleanups to bn_libc Add missing bn_check_top calls and relocate some others Use BN_is_zero where appropriate Remove asserts that bn_check_top is already covering Simplify the code in places esp bn_expand2 Only keep ambiguous zero handling if BN_STRICT isn't defined Remove some whitespace and make some other aesthetic tweaks
NOT BUG:Use the BN_is_odd macro in place of code that inconsistently does muchthe same thingAlso, I have some stuff on the backburner related to some BN_CTX notesfrom Peter Gutmann about his cryptlib hacks to the bignum code The BN_CTXcomments are there to remind me of some relevant points in the code
NOT BUG:BN_FLG_FREE is of extremely dubious usefulness, and is only referred toonce in the source where it is set for the benefit of no other codewhatsoever I've deprecated the declaration in the header and likewisemade the use of the flag conditional in bn_libc Note, this change alsoNULLs the 'd' pointer in a BIGNUM when it is reset but not deallocated
NOT BUG:Declare the static BIGNUM "BN_value_one" more carefully
NOT BUG:Add missing bn_check_tops to bn_kronc, remove some miscellaneouswhitespace, and include extra headers to satisfy debugging builds
NOT BUG:Add missing bn_check_tops to bn_gf2mc and remove some miscellaneouswhitespace
NOT BUG:The bn_set_max macro is only "used" by the bn_set_[low|high] macroswhich, in turn, are used nowhere at all This is a good thing becausebn_set_max would currently generate code that wouldn't compile BIGNUMhas no 'max' elementThe only apparent use for bn_set_[low|high] would be for implementingwindowing algorithms, and all of openssl's seem to use bn__wordshelpers instead including the BN_div that Nils fixed recently, which hadbeen using independentlycoded versions of what these unused macros areintended for I'm therefore consigning these macros to cvs oblivion in thename of readability
NOT BUG:bn_fix_top exists for compatibility's sake and is mapped tobn_correct_top or bn_check_top depending on debug settings Forinternal source, all bn_fix_tops should be converted one way or the otherdepending on whether the use of bn_correct_top is justifiedFor BN_div_recp, these cases should not require correction if the otherbignum functions are doing their jobs properly, so convert tobn_check_top

NOT BUG:Add more debugging to my Configure target, and "make update" to incorporatethis and a few other changes
NOT BUG:If BN_STRICT is defined, don't accept an ambiguous representation of zeroie where top may be zero, or it may be one if the corresponding word isset to zero Note, this only affects the macros in bnh, there are probablysimilar corrections required in some c filesAlso, clarify the auditrelated macros at the top of the header Mentalnote: I must not forget to clean all this out before 098 is released

NOT BUG:Put the first stage of my bignum debugging adventures into CVS This codeis itself experimental, and in addition may cause execution to break onexisting openssl "bugs" that previously were harmless or at leastinvisible
NOT BUG:Avoid some shadowed variable namesSubmitted by: Nils Larsch
NOT BUG:This is the least unacceptable way I've found for declaring the bignum dataand structures as constant without having to cast away const at any pointThere is still plenty of other code that makes gcc's "Wcastqual" unhappy,but crypto/bn/ is now ok Purists are welcome to suggest alternatives
NOT BUG:Engines are usually binary, and should therefore be in INSTALLTOPrather than OPENSSLDIR
NOT BUG:Let exit codes propagate from within for loops
BUG:bn_div does some pretty nasty things with temporary variables,constructing BIGNUM structures with pointers offset into other bignumsamong other things This corrects some of it that is too plainly insane,and tries to ensure that bignums are normalised when passed to otherfunctions
NOT BUG:When a BN_CTX is used for temporary workspace, the variables are sometimesleft in an inconsistent state when they are released for later reuse Thischange resets the BIGNUMs when they are released back to the context

NOT BUG:Some provisional bignum debugging has begun to detect inconsistent BIGNUMstructures being passed in to or out of API functions, and this corrects acouple of cases found so farAlso, lop off a couple of bytes of whitespace
NOT BUG:A general springcleaning in autumn to fix up signed/unsigned warningsI have tried to convert 'len' type variable declarations to unsigned as ameans to address these warnings when appropriate, but when in doubt I haveused casts in the comparisons instead The better solution that would getus all lynched by API users would be to go through and convert all thefunction prototypes and structure definitions to use unsigned variablesexcept when signed is necessary The proliferation of signed "int" forstrictly nonnegative uses is unfortunate
NOT BUG:BN_CTX is opaque and the static initialiser BN_CTX_init is not usedexcept internally to the allocator BN_CTX_new, as such this deprecatesthe use of BN_CTX_init in the API Moreover, the structure definition ofBN_CTX is taken out of bn_lclh and moved into bn_ctxc itselfNDEBUG should probably only be "forced" in the toplevel configuration, butuntil it is I will avoid removing it from bn_ctxc which might surprisepeople with massive slowdowns in their keygens So I've left it inbn_ctxc but tidied up the preprocessor logic a touch and made it moretolerant of debugging efforts
NOT BUG:Removing those memcpys also took away the possibility for in and out tobe the same  Therefore, the removed memcpys need to be restored
NOT BUG:remove accidentally committed debugging cruft
NOT BUG:Remove an unnecessary cast that causes certain compilers eg mine someconfusion Also silence a couple of signed/unsigned warnings
NOT BUG:Remove redundant declaration
NOT BUG:Relax some overzealous constification that gave some lhashbased code nochoice but to have to cast away "const" qualifiers from their prototypesThis does not remove constification restrictions from hash/comparecallbacks, but allows destructor commands to be run over a tables' elementswithout bad casts
NOT BUG:Comments out some unimplemented functions instead of redeclaring them
NOT BUG:Avoid "empty source file" warnings
NOT BUG:For whatever reason compiler or header bugs, at least one commonlyusedlinux system namely mine chokes on our definitions and uses of the "HZ"symbol in crypto/tmdiff[ch] and apps/speedc as a "bad function cast"when in fact there is no function casting involved at all In both cases,it is easily worked around by not defining a cast into the macro andjiggling the expressions slightlyIn addition  this highlights some cruft in openssl that needs sorting outThe tmdiffh header is exported as part of the openssl API despite the factthat it is ugly as the driven sludge and not used anywhere in the library,applications, or utilities More weird still, almost identical code existsin apps/speedc though it looks to be slightly tweaked  so either tmdiffshould be updated and used by speedc, or it should be dumped because it'sobviously not useful enoughRather than removing it for now, I've changed the API for tmdiff to atleast make sense This involves taking the object type MS_TM from theimplementation and using it in the header rather than using "char " in theAPI and casting mercilessly in the code ugh If someone doesn't like"MS_TM" and the "ms_time_" naming, by all means change it This shouldbe a harmless improvement, because the existing API is clearly not veryuseful eg we reimplement it rather than using it in our own utilsHowever, someone still needs to take a hack at consolidating speedc andtmdiff[ch] somehow
NOT BUG:Update any code that was using deprecated functions so that everything buildsand links with OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED defined
NOT BUG:When OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED is defined, deprecated functions are or shouldbe precompiled out in the API headers This change is to ensure that ifit is defined when compiling openssl, the deprecated functions aren'timplemented either
NOT BUG:The "cryptodev" engine preprocessor logic used undefined symbols incomparisons It's better not to allow this, because it gives falsepositives when using compiler warnings that detect mistyped symbols

NOT BUG:Undefine OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED inside openssl application code if we arebeing built with it defined  it is not a symbol to affect how opensslitself builds, but to alter the way openssl headers can be used from an APIpoint of view The "deprecated" function wrappers will always remain insideOpenSSL at least as long as they're still being used internally :The exception is dsaparam which has been updated to the BN_GENCBbasedfunctions to test the new functionality If GENCB_TEST is defined, dsaparamwill support a "timebomb <n>" switch to cancel parametergeneration if itgets as far as 'n' seconds without completion
NOT BUG:This is a firstcut at improving the callback mechanisms used inkeygeneration and primechecking functions Rather than explicitly passingcallback functions and callerdefined context data for the callbacks, a newstructure BN_GENCB is defined that encapsulates this; a pointer to thestructure is passed to all such functions insteadThis wrapper structure allows the encapsulation of "old" and "new" stylecallbacks  "new" callbacks return a boolean result on the understandingthat returning FALSE should terminate keygen/primality processing  TheBN_GENCB abstraction will allow future callback modifications withoutneeding to break binary compatibility nor change the API functionprototypes The new API functions have been given names ending in "_ex" andthe old functions are implemented as wrappers to the new ones  TheOPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED symbol has been introduced so that, if defined,declaration of the older functions will be skipped NB: Someopensslinternal code will stick with the older callbacks for now, soappropriate "undef" logic will be put in place  this is in case the useris building openssl rather than including its headers with thissymbol definedThere is another change in the new _ex functions; the keygenerationfunctions do not return key structures but operate on structures passed bythe caller, the return value is a boolean This will allow for a smoothertransition to having keygeneration as "virtual function" in the various_METHOD tables

NOT BUG:On certain platforms, we redefine certain symbols using macros inappsh  For those, it's better to include appsh after the systemheaders where those symbols may be defined, since there's otherwise achance that the C compiler will barf when it sees something that lookslike this after expansion:int VMS_strcasecmpstr1,str2const char , const char ;

NOT BUG:Make pod2man happier
NOT BUG:If dynamicallyloadable ENGINEs are linked against a sharedlibrary versionof libcrypto, then it is possible that when they are loaded they will sharethe same static data as the loading application/library This means it willbe too late to set memory/ERR/ex_data/[etc] callbacks, but entirelyunnecessary to try This change puts a static variable in the core ENGINEcode contained in libcrypto and a function returning a pointer to it Ifthe loaded ENGINE's return value from this function matches the loadingapplication/library's return value  they share static data If they don'tmatch, the loaded ENGINE has its own copy of libcrypto's static data and sothe callbacks need to be setAlso, although 097 hasn't been released yet, it's clear this willintroduce a binary incompatibility between dynamic ENGINEs built for 097and 098 though others probably exist already from EC_ hooks andwhatnot  so the version control values are correspondingly bumped

BUG:Eh, Wl,wholearchive disappeared from the GNU targets  I've noidea why, but that was definitely wrong
NOT BUG:The ENGINE implementations in /engines/ should be role models on how towrite external engines and thus should require only installed opensslheaders and libs to compile without warnings So this gets rid of recentlyintroduced compilation warnings no longer including internal headers byincluding stringh directly
NOT BUG: Remo Inverardi noticed that ENGINEs don't have an "up_ref" function in thenormal 'structural' case ENGINE_init satisfies this in the less normal'functional' case This change provides such a function Correct some "read" locks that should actually be "write" locks make update

NOT BUG:There are problems on certain platforms, and possible answers on how to temporarly solve them
NOT BUG:For those wanting to build for several platforms with the same sourcedirectory, making a separate directory tree with lots of symbolic linksseems to be the solution  Unfortunately, Configure doesn't take appropriatesteps to support this solution as in removing a file that's going to berewritten  This change corrects that situation  Now I just have tofind all other places where there's lack of support for this

NOT BUG:A number of includes were removed from evph some time ago  The reasonwas that they weren't really needed any more for EVP itself  However,it seems like soma applications I know about OpenSSH, but there maybe more used evph as the 'load all' header file, which makes sensesince we try our best to promote the use of EVP instead of the lowerlevel crypto algorithms  Therefore, I put the inclusions back sothe application authors don't get too shocked by all the errors theywould otherwise getThanks to Theo de Raadt for making us aware of this

NOT BUG:With the changed des_old API, let's complete the work by renaming thefunctions in ui_compat  This gave reason to rework that part morethoroughly, so here are the changes made:1 Add DES_read_password and DES_read_2passwords with the samefunctionality as the corresponding old des_ functions, as aconvenience to the users2 Add UI_UTIL_read_pw_string and UI_UTIL_read_pw with thefunctionality from des_read_pw_string and des_read_pw, again asa concenience to the users3 Rename des_read_password, des_read_2passwords,des_read_pw_string and des_read_pw by changing des_ to_ossl_old_des_, and add the usual mapping macros4 Move the implementation of des_read_password anddes_read_2passwords to the des directory, since they are tightlytied to DES anywayThis change was inspired by a patch from Assar Westerlund <assar@sicsse>:There are some functions that didn't get the kickawayolddesandreplacedeswithDES action  Here's a patch that adds DES_ and des_in des_oldh versions of des_read_pw_string et al  This patchincludes some of the first des_oldh semicolon macro fixes that I'vealready sent

NOT BUG:Because Rijndael is more known as AES, use crypto/aes instead ofcrypto/rijndael  Additionally, I applied the AES integration patchfrom Stephen Sprunk <stephen@sprunkorg> and fiddled it to workproperly with the normal EVP constructs and incidently work the sameway as all other symmetric cipher implementationsThis results in an API that looks a lot like the rest of the OpenSSLcipher suite
NOT BUG:The block size may be something other than 8!

NOT BUG:fix warnings one of them was clearly justified
NOT BUG:Don't overwrite signing time
NOT BUG:HPUX 9X on m68k with gcc"Anton J Gamel" <gamel@annaanatomieunifreiburgde>
NOT BUG:UID was never a lable for uniqueIdentifier  However, LDAP and certainRFCs concerning X500 directories use UID as a shorter name for theattribute type userId, which is defined by CCITT and available throughRFCs 1274 and 2247Unfortunately, if some applications have used the name "UID" for theuniqueIdentifier attribute type, they will produce incorrect resultsHowever, I found it better to follow the standards that are out thererather than having our own incompatible one
NOT BUG:I was recently informed that some people wrongly use ssleaytxt asmain documentation, so let's warn them a little more, so the word"OBSOLETE" really gets understood
NOT BUG:crypto/objects stuff

BUG:OS/390 supportSubmitted by: Richard Shapiro <rshapiro@abinitiocom>
NOT BUG:comment
BUG:Cut "ENGINE_ID" to the more concise "ID"
NOT BUG:In this particular error condition, the structural reference wasn't beingreleased
NOT BUG:When the "dynamic" ENGINE loads another ENGINE from a sharedlibrary, itessentially overwrites itself with the new ENGINE, with the exception ofreference counts, ex_data structures, and other 'admin' elements Howeverif the new ENGINE doesn't populate certain elements, there's the risk ofthe "dynamic" ENGINE's elements showing through  the "cmd_defns" were justone of the possibilities This implements a more comprehensive cleanup
NOT BUG:The "openssl" ENGINE is no longer used except as a testing/debuggingdevice This change enables it for building as a selfcontained "dynamic"ENGINE, to help testing such mechanisms
NOT BUG:'flags' should only be set inside DSO_load if constructing a new DSOobject  otherwise we overwrite any flags that had been previously set inthe DSO before calling DSO_load
NOT BUG:Extentions of the explanations to the linking problem on Win32  Provided by Andrew Gray <agray@iconsinccom>
NOT BUG:Clarify reference count handling/removal of sessionshinagawa@starzkodeccom
NOT BUG:On VMS, the norm is still that symbols are uppercased, so for now it's betterto trust that norm  I might implement a control for this later on
NOT BUG:wNAFs use does not bring that much performance on Sparcs whereelliptic curves are are relatively faster than on PCs anyway
NOT BUG:avoid stupid compiler warning
NOT BUG:Build dynamic rsaref engine on VMS  Tested on VAX so far
NOT BUG:End assembler macro correctlyOn VAX, all global variables are accessed through functions, so skipdoing transfer entries for variablesForgot the looping gotos
NOT BUG:On systems that don't do too well including headers from a differentdirectory, trust the building scripts to handle it properly

NOT BUG:Make it possible to give digest names as evp arguments
NOT BUG:Add DES functionsRestructure the code and comment it a bitPrepare for the presence of digests
NOT BUG:If an engine isn't built in, try loading it as a shareable libraryinstead  This also makes it possible for users to simply give saidshareable library as argument for the engine option
NOT BUG:At least for the two common Unixly DSO loading methods, include thesystem error in the error text
NOT BUG:Use the generated error code files
NOT BUG:'make update' + some touches
NOT BUG:Add targets to update the error code files
NOT BUG:Add a local error code configuration file for the rsaref dynamicengine
NOT BUG:Make it possible to build completely static, independent error Cfiles
NOT BUG:make updateperl util/mkerrpl recurse write rebuild
NOT BUG:Make use of RSAref's header files instead of EAY's crafted rsarefh
NOT BUG:In a Debian Linux environment, it's not a good idea, apparently, tomanually declare the include directory /usr/include at the same timeas the macro PROTOTYPES is defined with the value 1  Besides,/usr/include is the standard include directory anyway, so there's noneed to specify it explicitely
NOT BUG:Add a demo that reimplements the RSAref glue in form of a dynamicallyloadable engine
NOT BUG:After loading a dynamic engine, reset the command definitions to theempty set  This prevents engines that do not set the commanddefinitions themselves to inherit the ones from "dynamic", which wouldotherwise be very confusing
NOT BUG:Change the order of events so the capabilities of loaded engines canget listed as well
NOT BUG:remove obsolete entry
NOT BUG:cast to unsigned int, not to int to avoid the warning  all thesevalues really are unsigned

NOT BUG:clarify
NOT BUG:Don't define _REENTRANT here in e_osh  On systems where we need_REENTRANT if threads support is enabled, the /Configure entry mustdefine it so that it ends up in CFLAG
NOT BUG:PKCS12 code fixes: initialize and cleanup digests and ciphersproperly
NOT BUG:Win32 fixes

NOT BUG:No need to include anything on systems that do not have /dev/crypt
NOT BUG:DOS and Windows do not like unistdh
NOT BUG:If verify fails, say why
NOT BUG:Change the shared library support so the shared libraries get builtsooner and the programs get built against the shared librariesThis requires a bit more work  Things like rpath and the possibilityto still link the programs statically should be included  Somecleanup is also needed  This will be worked on
NOT BUG:Addapt VMS scripts to the newer disk layout system ODS5, which allows more than one period and mixed size characters in file names
NOT BUG:Another noemailDN fix

NOT BUG:remove redundant definitions that are also in desh
NOT BUG:mention des_oldh
NOT BUG:Add 'noemailDN' option to 'openssl ca'  This prevents inclusion ofthe email address in the DN ie, it will go into a certificateextension only  The new configuration file option 'email_in_dn  no'has the same effectSubmitted by: Massimiliano Pala madwolf@opencaorg
NOT BUG:filenames are des_old[ch], not descomp
BUG:Consistency with s2_ and s23_ variants no real functionalchange
NOT BUG:Remove DES_random_seed but retain des_random_seed for now  Changethe docs to reflect this change and correct libeaynum
NOT BUG:Assume TLS 10 when ClientHello fragment is too short
NOT BUG:Have the removal warnings very high up in the source
NOT BUG:A C file is a C file is a C file!
NOT BUG:Due to an increasing number of clashes between modern OpenSSL andlibdes which is still used out there or other des implementations,the OpenSSL DES functions are renamed to begin with DES_ instead ofdes_  Compatibility routines are provided and declared by includingopenssl/des_oldh  Those declarations are the same as were in deshwhen the OpenSSL project started, which is exactly how libdes lookedat that time, and hopefully still looks todayThe compatibility functions will be removed in some future release, atthe latest in version 10

NOT BUG:Update docs
NOT BUG:Retain compatibility of EVP_DigestInit and EVP_DigestFinalwith existing codeModify library to use digest _ex functions
NOT BUG:The message header for fake SSL 30/TLS 10 client hellos created fromSSL 20 client hellos added with the previous commit was totally wrong it must start with the message type, not the protocol versionNot that this particular header is actually used anywhere

BUG:openbsdx86 macrosSubmitted by: Toomas Kiisk <vix@cyberee>
NOT BUG:Update information as a partial response to the postFrom: "Chris D Peterson" <cpeterson@aventailcom>Subject: Implementation Issues with OpenSSLTo: opensslusers@opensslorgDate: Wed, 22 Aug 2001 16:13:17 0700The patch included in the original post may improve the internal sessionlist handling and is therefore worth a seperate investigationNo change to the list handling will however solve the problems of incorrectSSL_SESSION_free calls The session list is only one possible point offailure, dangling pointers would also occur for SSL object currentlyusing the session The correct solution is to only use SSL_SESSION_freewhen applicable!
NOT BUG:In certain cases, no encoding has been set up for the b64 filter  Insuch cases, a flush should not attempt to finalise the encoding, asthe EVP_ENCODE_CTX structure will only be filled with garbage  Forthe same reason, do the same check when a wpending is performed
NOT BUG:'make update'
NOT BUG:Add support for md4WithRSAEncryption
NOT BUG:For systems where gcc is used and where we don't know if GNU ld isused or not, let's ask collect2 which ld it uses and choose to use thetarget dognu_shared if GNU ld is usedThis solves the reported problems on Solaris systems where GNU cc isused but GNU ld isn't, and probably on other systems with similarsetups
NOT BUG:'make update'
NOT BUG:It seems like gcc does canonicalisation of file names  Morespecifically, a starting '/' is removed  makedepend doesn't do this,resulting in another possible commit war, so let's fix that by doing apoor mans canonicalisation of file names that gives the same effect asdoing dependencies through gcc
NOT BUG:'make update'
NOT BUG:To avoid commit wars over dependencies, let's make it so things thatdepend on the environment, like the presence of the OpenBSD cryptodevice or of Kerberos, do not change the dependencies within OpenSSL
NOT BUG:makedepend sometimes produces duplicates  Remove them
NOT BUG:A few more OIDs, contributed by Peter Sylvester <PeterSylvester@EdelWebfr>
NOT BUG:evp_testc and evpteststxt both need to be linked in the test/ directoryhowever for different reasons This separation should prevent the win32build from interpreting evpteststxt as source code
NOT BUG:Change some EVP prototypes to use "cipher" rather than "type" as a variablename The implementations already use this anyway
NOT BUG:EVP_EncryptInit_ex and EVP_DecryptInit_ex had been defined in evph butnot implemented Bug reported by Martin SzotkowskiThis also changes the non"_ex" versions to defer directly toEVP_CipherInit_ex rather than EVP_CipherInit to avoid an unecessarylevel of indirection
NOT BUG:As ENGINE_load_openbsd_dev_crypto is an API function, it makes sense forit to be defined on all platforms whether or not it is of any practicaluse on them This also resolves linker problems on "special" platforms,such as win32
NOT BUG:Make sure the "ENGINE_TABLE" cleanup callbacks have correct prototypes
NOT BUG:Missing pointer in the eng_table_register function Reported byMartin Szotkowski
NOT BUG:Small documentation fixes Howard Lum <howard@pumpkincanadasuncom>
NOT BUG:Copy evpteststxt to the right place
NOT BUG:Typo
NOT BUG:SSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack for Win32 finally implementedSubmitted by Massimo Santin <msantin@santineassociaticom>
NOT BUG:'make update'
NOT BUG:Since ossl_typh is an exported header, we sure need to export it onVMS as well :
NOT BUG:Because there's chances we clash with the system's typesh, rename ourtypesh to ossl_typhAlso, it seems like krb5 was forgotten in some places
NOT BUG:Because there's chances we clash with the system's typesh, rename ourtypesh to ossl_typh
NOT BUG:Use the maximum block length for the extra size in the encryptBIO buffer instead of hard coding it as 8
NOT BUG:Make EVP_DecryptUpdate work again
NOT BUG:sch isn't an array, how did this pass through gcc?
NOT BUG:A lot of things are undeclared unless x509h is included
NOT BUG:Hmm, everything "open" isn't necessarely "openssl" :sigh habit
BUG:Woopsie
NOT BUG:'make update'
NOT BUG:sk_ENGINE_CLEANUP_ITEM_pop_free is duplicated in ENGINE_cleanupLet's use sk_ENGINE_CLEANUP_ITEM_pop_free instead
NOT BUG:Addapt seldom compiled code to new semantics of the key schedule nota pointer any more
NOT BUG:Some new symbols have very long names
BUG:o_timec contains symbols with dollar signs in them, so we must tellthe compiler not to warn about that
NOT BUG:The cleanup stack in ENGINE changed slightly, so this "make update" isneeded
NOT BUG:The STACK macros take care of casting to and from the designated item typeof the stack, and the void  type used in the underlying sk_functions  However, declaring a STACK_OFtype where type is a functiontype implicitly involves casts between function pointers and data pointersThat's a nono This changes the ENGINE_CLEANUP handling to use a regulardata type in the stack
NOT BUG:Make an overdue note about the recent ENGINE restructuring Apart froma few items however, most of the details are deferred to thecrypto/engine/README file
NOT BUG:Make "openssl engine c" list any supported digests as well as supportedciphers
BUG:Typos Chris Pepper <pepper@mailreppepcom>
NOT BUG:Change HZ in speed to rely on sysconf if the clock tick is availablethat way  Synchronise s_time with these changes
NOT BUG:ENGINE_register_all_complete will register all implementations of allalgorithms present in all loaded ENGINEs The result is that if any ofthose ENGINEs successfully initialises, and the ENGINE_TABLE_FLAG_NOINITflag isn't set, then they will always be used and cached as defaults inpreference to software implementations Ie accidental autodetection ofacceleration hardware :This change stops all implementations being automatically registered in"openssl" subcommands, so that the "setup_engine" handler in appsccontrols which ENGINEs are registered for use A special case has beenadded that will revert to this "autodetect" logic, ie if the "engine"switch is used as;engine auto
NOT BUG:Modernise and fix ancient "maurice" demos
NOT BUG:Constify EVP_SealInit, EVP_OpenInit
NOT BUG:Make ancient signc demo compile again
BUG:Support fractional seconds in GeneralizedTime
NOT BUG:Synchronise with Unixly build
NOT BUG:Stop thinking arguments starting with  are algorithm identifiersShow timing parameters and timing functions usedIt looks like some Linuxen have very weird settings for CLK_TCK  I'mvery unsure about this change and will investigate further
NOT BUG:Apparently, Linux is identified with __linux__ as well
NOT BUG:'make update'
NOT BUG:The error message must match a very specific regexp see mkdefpl,currently line 470
NOT BUG:Don't clean up stuff twice
NOT BUG:Fixes
NOT BUG:Two changes:1 if there are several symbols with the same entry number, sort thosesymbols in ASCII order2 Do not stop reading the header files when "BEGIN ERROR CODES" isfound, since mkerrpl will add a function declaration after thatcomment  Instead, trigger on "Error codes for the \w+ function",which is the actual start of the error code macrosAdditionally, a few more debugging printouts that helped
NOT BUG:Fix warning
NOT BUG:"FALLBACK" handling was a hack that was thrown out long ago in theENGINE redevelopment The idea had been that "1" could be used as aspecial "ask me later" 'nid' rather than specifying supported cipher anddigest 'nid's up front However the idea turned out to be pretty broken
NOT BUG:Make update to bring in all the cipher/digestrelated ENGINE changesNB: It looks like mkdefpl is causing certain cvs wars by continuallyflipping the order of some definitions 
NOT BUG:Put the cipher info back into the "openssl engine" command
NOT BUG:Fiddling
NOT BUG:This change puts the original OpenBSD /dev/crypto support that was incrypto/evp/ into the corresponding ENGINE This code is currently untested
NOT BUG:This change adds dummy RC4 and SHA1 support to the "openssl" ENGINE fortesting Because of the recent changes see crypto/engine/README, the"openssl" ENGINE is no longer needed nor is it loaded automatically or byENGINE_load_builtin_engines So a explicit ENGINE_load_openssl call isrequired by applications or a modification to eng_allc before this ENGINEwill be used This change will send output to stderr as/when itsimplementations are used
NOT BUG:This changes EVP's cipher and digest code to hook via the ENGINE supportSee crypto/engine/README for details it also removes openbsd_hwc from the build that functionality isgoing to be available in the openbsd ENGINE in a upcoming commit evp_test has had the extra initialisation added so it will use ifpossible any ENGINEs supporting the algorithms required
NOT BUG:This change adds cipher and digest support into ENGINE using theENGING_TABLE mechanism The necessary hooks from crypto/evp/ to use thiswill be committed shortly
NOT BUG:indentation
NOT BUG:"make update"
NOT BUG:Make necessary tweaks to apps/ files due to recent ENGINE surgery Seecrypto/engine/README for details
NOT BUG:This commits changes to various parts of libcrypto required by the recentENGINE surgery DH, DSA, RAND, and RSA now use both "method" and ENGINEpointers to manage their hooking with ENGINE Previously their use of"method" pointers was replaced by use of ENGINE references Seecrypto/engine/README for detailsAlso, remove the ENGINE iterations from evp_test  even when thecipher/digest code is committed in, this functionality would require adifferent set of API calls
NOT BUG:This commits the changes to STACK macros forced by recent ENGINE surgery
NOT BUG:This change replaces the ENGINE's underlying mechanics with the newENGINE_TABLEbased stuff  as described in crypto/engine/READMEAssociated miscellaneous changes; the previous cipher/digest hooks that hardwired directly to EVP'sOBJ_NAMEbased storage have been backed out New cipher/digest supporthas been constructed and will be committed shortly each implementation defines its own ENGINE_load_<name> function now the "openssl" ENGINE isn't needed or loaded any more core not algorithm or class specific ENGINE code has been split intomultiple files to increase readability and decrease linker bloat ENGINE_cpy has been removed as it wasn't really a good idea in thefirst place and now, because of registration issues, can't bemeaningfully defined any more BN_MOD_EXP[_CRT] support is removed as per the README a bug in enginetestc has been fixedNB: This commit almost certainly breaks compilation until subsequentchanges are committed
NOT BUG:Some major restructuring changes to ENGINE, including integrated cipher anddigest support, are on their way Rather than having gigantic commit logmessages and/or CHANGES entries, this change to the README will serve as anoutline of what it all is and how it all works
NOT BUG:Fix AES CBC mode EVP_CIPHER structures: the IV length is always16

NOT BUG:ENGINE uses a very opaque design, so we can predeclare the structure typein "typesh" so that very few headers will need to include engineh,generally only C files using API functions will need it reducingthe header dependencies quite a lot
NOT BUG:ENGINE files were renamed, and error strings are now in eng_errc

NOT BUG:Renaming DH_up to DH_up_ref does not warrant a CHANGES entry of its ownas the functions were only introduced a couple of days agoSome '' apparently should be '+' as the changes do not applyto the 096 bugfix branch
NOT BUG:ENGINEs can now perform structural cleanup
NOT BUG:This adds "destroy" handlers to the existing ENGINEs that load their ownerror strings  the destroy handler functions unload the error strings soany pending error state referring to them will not attempt to referencethem after the ENGINE has been destroyed
NOT BUG:ENGINE's init and finish handler functions are used when the ENGINE isbeing enabled or disabled respectively for operation Additionally, eachENGINE has a constructor function where it can do more 'structural' levelintialisations such as loading error strings, creating "ex_data" indices,etc This change introduces a handler function that gives an ENGINE acorresponding opportunity to cleanup when the ENGINE is being destroyed Italso adds the "get/set" API functions that control this "destroy" handlerfunction in an ENGINE

BUG:strsep implementation to allow the file to compile on nonBSD systemsSubmitted by: "Brian Havard" <brianh@kheldarapanaorgau>
NOT BUG:Make the 'dynamic' ENGINE bundle up the loading application/library'slocking callbacks to pass to the loaded library in addition to theexisting mem, ex_data, and err callbacks Also change the defaultimplementation of the "bind_engine" function to apply those callbacks, iethe IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC_BIND_FN macro
NOT BUG:Add a "_up" > "_up_ref" change to libeaynum that was missing from therecent changes Also, do the same change to the DSO_up function
NOT BUG:typo
NOT BUG:Now that we have ERR_unload_strings, ERR_load_ERR_strings mustalways load its strings because they might have been unloadedsince the 'init' flag was deletedBut build_SYS_str_reasons can use an 'init' flag
NOT BUG:changing something requires a write lock, not a read lock
NOT BUG:CHANGES should list all API changes relevant for applicationshere: X509_STORE_CTX_init
BUG:OpenSSL copyright notices 
NOT BUG:delete redundant ERR_load_CRYPTO_strings prototype
NOT BUG:This changes the existing hardware ENGINE implementations to dynamicallydeclare their own error strings so that they can be more easily compiled asexternal sharedlibraries if desired Also, each implementation has beengiven canonical "dynamic" support at the base of each file and is onlybuilt if the ENGINE_DYNAMIC_SUPPORT symbol is definedAlso, use "void" prototypes rather than empty prototypes in engine_inthThis does not yet;i remove error strings when unloading,ii remove the redundant ENGINE_R_ codes though ENGINE_F_ codeshave gone, oriii provide any instructions on how to build sharedlibrary ENGINEs oruse themAll are on their way
NOT BUG:This change adds a new ENGINE called "dynamic" that allows new ENGINEimplementations to be loaded from selfcontained sharedlibraries It alsoprovides in engineh definitions and macros to help implement aselfcontained ENGINE Version control is handled in a way whereby theloader or loadee can veto the load depending on any objections it has witheach other's declared interface level The way this is currentlyimplemented assumes a veto will only take place when one side notices theother's interface level is too old If the other side is newer, it shouldbe assumed the newer version knows better whether to veto the load or notVersion checking like other "dynamic" settings can be controlled usingthe "dynamic" ENGINE's control commands Also, the semantics for theloading allow a sharedlibrary ENGINE implementation to handle differinginterface levels on the fly eg loading secondary sharedlibrariesdepending on the versions requiredCode will be added soon to the existing ENGINEs to illustrate how they canbe built as external libraries rather than building statically intolibcryptoNB: Applications wanting to support "dynamic"loadable ENGINEs will need toadd support for ENGINE "control commands" See apps/enginec for an exampleof this, and use "apps/openssl engine vvvv" to test or experiment
NOT BUG:Note the "ERR_unload_strings" function
NOT BUG:Add a new ERR function, "ERR_unload_strings", to complement the existing"ERR_load_strings" function
NOT BUG:Correct a typo

NOT BUG:Convert "max" to "mx" for variable names brought to my attention by SteveHenson Also, reverse a previous change that used an implicit functionpointer cast rather than an explicit data pointer cast in the STACK cleanupcode
NOT BUG:Make MD functions take EVP_MD_CTX  instead of void , add copy function
NOT BUG:Note the "ex_data" changes
NOT BUG:Make the necessary changes to work with the recent "ex_data" overhaulSee the commit log message for that for more informationNB: X509_STORE_CTX's use of "ex_data" support was actually misimplementedinitialisation by "memset" won't/can't/doesn't work This fixes that butrequires that X509_STORE_CTX_init be able to handle errors  so itsprototype has been changed to return 'int' rather than 'void' All uses ofthat function throughout the source code have been tracked down andadjusted
NOT BUG:First step in fixing "ex_data" support Warning: big commit log Currently, this change merely addresses where ex_data indexes are storedand managed, and thus fixes the threadsafety issues that existed at thatlevel "Class" code eg RSA, DSA, etc no longer store their own STACKSand perclass index counters  all such data is stored inside ex_datac Sorather than passing both STACK+counter to indexmanagement ex_datafunctions, a 'class_index' is instead passed to indicate the class egCRYPTO_EX_INDEX_RSA New classes can be dynamically registered ontheflyand this is also threadsafe inside ex_datac though whether the callermanages the return value in a threadsafe way is not addressedThis does not change the "get/set" functions on individual "ex_data"structures, and so threadsafety at that level isn't yet assuredLikewise, the method of getting and storing perclass indexes has notchanged, so locking may still be required at the "caller" end but isnonetheless threadsafe inside "ex_data"'s internal implementationTypically this occurs when code implements a new method of some kind andstores its own perclass index in a global variable without locking thesetting and usage of that variable If the code in question is likely to beused in multiple threads, locking the setting and use of that index isstill up to the code in question Possible fixes to this are beingsketched, but definitely require more major changes to the API itself thanthis change undertakesThe underlying implementation in ex_datac has also been modularised sothat alternative "ex_data" implementations that control all access tostate can be plugged in Eg a loaded module can have its implementationset to that of the application loaded it  the result being thatthreadsafety and consistency of "ex_data" classes and indexes can bemaintained in the same place rather than the loaded module using its owncopy of ex_data support code and stateDue to the centralisation of "state" with this change, cleanup of all"ex_data" state can now be performed properly Previously all allocation ofex_data state was guaranteed to leak  and MemCheck_off had been used toavoid it flagging up the memory debugging A new function has been added toperfrom all this cleanup, CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data The "openssl"commands have been changed to use this cleanup, as have the relevant testprograms External application code may want to do so too  failure tocleanup will not induce more memory leaking than was the case before, butthe memory debugging is not tricked into hiding it any more so it may"appear" where it previously did not

NOT BUG:Make a note of the "up" functions
NOT BUG:Changes crypto/evp/ and ssl/ code from directly incrementing referencecounts in DH, DSA, and RSA structures Instead they use the new "_up"functions that handle this

BUG:More Kerberos SSL patches from Vern Staats <staatsvr@aschpcmil>His comments are:This patch fixes the problem of modern Kerberos using "derived keys"to encrypt the authenticator by disabling the authenticator checkfor all derived keys enctypesI think I've got all the bugfixes that Jeffrey and I discussed rolledinto this  There were some problems with Jeffrey's code to convertthe authenticator's Kerberos timestring into struct tm eg Z, 1900;it helps to have an actual decryptable authenticator to play withSo I've shamelessly pushed in my code, while stealing some bits fromJeffrey
NOT BUG:Updated explanation
NOT BUG:Some more documentation bits
NOT BUG:Currently, RSA code, when using no padding scheme, simply checks that inputdoes not contain more bytes than the RSA modulus 'n'  it does not checkthat the input is strictly less than 'n' Whether this should be thecase or not is open to debate  however, due to security problems withreturning miscalculated CRT results, the 'rsa_mod_exp' implementation inrsa_eayc now performs a publickey exponentiation to verify the CRT resultand in the event of an error will instead recalculate and return a nonCRTmore expensive mod_exp calculation As the mod_exp of 'I' is equivalentto the mod_exp of 'I mod n', and the verify result is automatically between0 and n1 inclusive, the verify only matches the input if 'I' was less than'n', otherwise even a correct CRT calculation is only congruent to 'I' iethey differ by a multiple of 'n' Rather than rejecting correctcalculations and doing redundant and slower ones instead, this changes theequality check in the verification code to a congruence check

NOT BUG:A better compromise between encrypt and decrypt but why isn't it as fastfor encrypt?
NOT BUG:Handle the common case first where input size is a multiple of block sizeWorth around 5 for encrypt Slows down decrypt slightly, but I expect toregain that later
NOT BUG:Use & instead of   worth about 4 for 8 byte blocks

NOT BUG:Fix warning
BUG:Insuline shot
BUG:Changes to have OpenSSL compile on OS/2Contributed by "Brian Havard" <brianh@kheldarapanaorgau>
NOT BUG:Modify apps to use NCONF code instead of old CONF codeAdd new extension functions which work with NCONFTidy up extension config routines and remove redundant codeFix NCONF_get_numberTodo: more testing of apps to see they still work
NOT BUG:Make better use of load_cert, load_certs and load_key
NOT BUG:Another empty X509_NAME fix
NOT BUG:Handle empty X509_NAME in printing routines
NOT BUG:DSA verification should insist that r and s are in the allowed range
NOT BUG:Make better use of load_cert, load_certs and load_key
NOT BUG:Make get_ip a bit more strict in it's parsing of IP addresses, andat the same time a bit more accepting with host names
NOT BUG:Make better use of load_cert, load_certs and load_key
NOT BUG:Translate into valid C don't call functions with wrong prototypes
NOT BUG:Call apps_shutdown to take down what apps_startup set up
NOT BUG:Make sure we don't return 0 on error
NOT BUG:In {RSA,DSA,DH}_new_methodx need to increase the referencecount of the ENGINE is x is not NULL since it will be freedin {RSA,DSA,DH}_free
NOT BUG:Use the new UI features, among others the new boolean inputNOTE: Boolean input hasn't been very well tested yet, so this part mayfail miserably
NOT BUG:Including stdioh before setting _XOPEN_SOURCE and_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED wasn't very smart
NOT BUG:make update
NOT BUG:Use apps_shutdown in all applications, in case someone decides notto go the monolith way does anyone do that these days?NOTE: a few applications are missing in this commit  I've a few morechanges in them that I haven't tested yet
NOT BUG:apps_startup needs a corresponding apps_shutdown
NOT BUG:Make use of new features in UI's  Among others, the applicationpassword callbak doesn't need to check for sizes any more
NOT BUG:Oops, applies to 097 only
NOT BUG:Document recent changes
NOT BUG:Do not loop i the OpenSSL UI method any more  Instead, lettheapplication do thatNOTE: there's no requirement for other UI_METHODs to avoid this kindof loop  For example, a GUI UI_METHOD would probably check thelengths of the answers from within instead of being constantlyredisplayed for everything that is wrong
NOT BUG:make update
NOT BUG:Implement boolean yes/no or OK/Cancel,  inputImplement UI controls  Current controls are the possibility to outputthe OpenSSL error stack on the same channel from within UI_processand to check if the same user interface can be redone without beingrebuilt this is often more a question of philosophy thantechnicalities
NOT BUG:New error printing function that gives the possibility to print theerrors through an arbitrary function
NOT BUG:Include the UI error strings
NOT BUG:For the UI functions that return an int, 0 or any positive number is asuccess return, any negative number is a failure  Make sure we checkthe return value with that in mind

NOT BUG:Fix UI leak in apps
NOT BUG:In UI_dup_ function, use the duped string, not the original
NOT BUG:Update my config entry to allow use of DSOs
NOT BUG:This fixes "Spurious test failures on IRIX?" reported in April ApparentlyI was wrong in conclusions about when addition starts overflowing in combaXroutines
NOT BUG:Fix memory leak when RAND is used: need to cleanupRANDs ENGINE reference in ENGINE_cleanup
NOT BUG:Update my status
NOT BUG:Since there is a way to create UI_METHODs, implement a destructor aswellThis probably requires reference counters and locks as well  To beimplemented later
NOT BUG:Modify "openssl engine" to handle and display internal controlcommands appropriately
NOT BUG:Change all calls to low level digest routines in the library andapplications to use EVP Add missing calls to HMAC_cleanup anddon't assume HMAC_CTX can be copied using memcpyNote: this is almost identical to the patch submitted to openssldevby Verdon Walker <VWalker@novellcom> except some redundantEVP_add_digest_/EVP_cleanup calls were removed and some changesmade to avoid compiler warnings
NOT BUG:Fix memory leaks
NOT BUG:cp is only used when DSA is built
NOT BUG:Do a proof of concept  "openssl genrsa" will make the name of thefile part of the password prompt unless it's standard inputMore will be added
NOT BUG:Change the common application routines to use a UI_METHOD for passwordprompting, even when done through the callback
NOT BUG: Add the possibility to control engines through control names butwith arbitrary arguments instead of just a string Change the key loaders to take a UI_METHOD instead of a callbackfunction pointer  NOTE: this breaks binary compatibility withearlier versions of OpenSSL [engine] Addapt the nCipher code for these new conditions and add a cardinsertion callback
NOT BUG:The default flag should be for default passwords only  Otherwise,someone having a default that is not a password will be confused
NOT BUG:Enhance the user interface with better support for dialog boxprompting, applicationdefined prompts, the possibility to usedefaults for example default passwords from somewhere else andinterrupts/cancelations
NOT BUG:make apps compile again
NOT BUG:Don't set pointer if add_lock_callback used
NOT BUG:One feature wasn't quite commited yet
NOT BUG:Provide an applicationcommon setup function for engines and use iteverywhere
NOT BUG:Fix a memory leak there's another around here somewhere, thoughPR:
NOT BUG:Delete a redundant line
NOT BUG:pay attention to blocksize before attempting decryption
BUG:For MSDOS, the tty filename still is "con", not "/dev/tty" 
NOT BUG:Get rid of "possible WAW dependency" warningsSubmitted by:Reviewed by:PR:
NOT BUG:even use of default engines leaks memory
NOT BUG:Add directory name to the entry on /crypto/ui/
NOT BUG:Earlier OpenSSL versions printed prompts to stderrIn the new crypto/ui/, this was changed into tty which is usually/dev/tty, ie the FILE  used for reading passwords from the userHowever stdio buffering for read/write streams is not without pitfallspasswords would be echoed on some systemsTo avoid problems, split tty into tty_in and tty_out which areopened separately
NOT BUG:Make update
NOT BUG:Initialize UI ex_data
NOT BUG:Add support for MS CSP Name PKCS12 attribute
NOT BUG:more error codes fixed
NOT BUG:ERR_peek_error returns "unsigned long"
BUG:Use memmove instead of memcpy on areas that may overlapSpotted by Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhatcom>
NOT BUG:Don't forget to initialise
NOT BUG:OAEP fix
NOT BUG:when checking OAEP, signal just a single kind of 'decoding error'
NOT BUG:move check to avoid memory leak
NOT BUG:make sure we don't write to seed[1]
NOT BUG:'make update'
NOT BUG:Defining __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED was the wrong thing  Instead, define_XOPEN_SOURCE
NOT BUG:A good use of the UI interface is as a password callback replacementfor new functions  One might still want to be able to pass downa userdata pointer to be used by the UI  However, ex_data doesn'tquite cut it, since that means the appropriate index to it might needto be shared between parts that aren't really related in that sense,and would require the currently hidden static index holders to beuncovered  Not a good thing  Therefore, add the possibility to add auserdata pointer to a UI
NOT BUG:Small detail about AIX forgotten
BUG:Accept digits in symbol names  Spotted by Brian Havard <brianh@kheldarapanaorgau>
NOT BUG:More info on SRP

BUG:Don't decrement the reference counter twice when destroying dynamiclinks
NOT BUG:Fix a memory leak in 'sk_dup' in the case a realloc fails Also, tidy upa bit of weird code in sk_new
NOT BUG:Get rid of RAW dependency warningsSubmitted by:Reviewed by:PR:
NOT BUG:Extend all the loading functions to take an engine pointer, a passstring some engines may have certificates protected by a PIN! anda description to put into error messagesAlso, have our own password callback that we can send both a passwordand some prompt info to  The default password callback in EVP assumesthat the passed parameter is a password, which isn't always the rightthing, and the ENGINE code at least the nCipher one makes otherassumptionsAlso, in spite of having the functions to load keys, some utilitiesdid the loading all by themselves  That's changed too
BUG:A wish was expressed
BUG:Don't forget responsible person so that its clear who is to blame
NOT BUG:Assembler support for IA64 See the source code commentary for furtherdetails performance numbers and accompanying discussions: Note thatthe code is not engaged in /Configure yet I'll add it later this weekalong with updates for spec fileSubmitted by:Reviewed by:PR:
NOT BUG:Document the latest change in ENGINEs
NOT BUG:We had the password callback for ENGINEs pretty much wrong  Andpasswords that were given to the key loading functions were completelyignored, at least in the ncipher code, and then we made the assumptionthat the callback wanted a prompt as user argumentAll that is now changed, and the application author is forced to givea callback function of type pem_callback_cb and possibly an argumentfor it, just as for all other functions that want to generate passwordpromptingNOTE: this change creates binary and source incompatibilities withprevious versions of OpenSSL [engine]  It's worth it this time, toget it right or at least better and with a chance that it'll work
NOT BUG:Add missing variable length cipher flag for BlowfishOnly use trust settings if either trust or reject settingsare present, otherwise use compatibility mode This stopsroot CAs being rejected if they have alias of keyid set
NOT BUG:VMS doesn't support more than on period in a file name
NOT BUG:Add examples to EVP_EncryptInit manual page
NOT BUG:Fix for new UI functions under Win32For some unknown reason fopen"con", "w" is theonly way to make this work Using "r+" and "w+"causes the fopen call to fail and the fallbackusing stdin doesn't work because writing to stdinfails
NOT BUG:Add a requirements section for OpenVMS
NOT BUG:Add a few more details on what one might need  make and a developmentenvironment were a part of a Unix operating systems, but these daysyou see an increasing number of installations that do not necessarelyhave these crucial parts by default, so it's needs mentioning
NOT BUG:Add missing items SSL_ERROR_WANT_CONNECT, SSL_ERROR_WANT_ACCEPT
NOT BUG:New internal function OPENSSL_gmtime, which is intended to do the sameas gmtime_r on the systems where that is defined
NOT BUG:Increase ENTROPY_NEEDED to support Rijndael's larger key size
BUG:Do not forget to increment the pointers
NOT BUG:Lowcase the names of the system routines, since some versions ofDEC C only have them declared that way it doesn't really matter,since the linker is caseinsensitive by default
BUG:branch on equal is beql, not beq
NOT BUG:Make sure strdup is properly declared
NOT BUG:Make sure memset is properly declared
NOT BUG:ui was forgotten when installing libcrypto and it's headers
BUG:ui_compath was forgotten in the "symlinking" routine
NOT BUG:Remove the password reading objects from LIB_DES
NOT BUG:Make more short aliases for symbols that are longer than 31characters
NOT BUG:len is a size_t, which is an unsigned integer  Therefore, somecompilers will complain against the check for less than zero

NOT BUG:Define `ok' and better error detection
NOT BUG:make update
NOT BUG:Win16 too :
NOT BUG:des_read_password and des_read_2passwords can only appear if DESis compiled
NOT BUG:When doing rewrites on ssleaynum, the file was prematurely closedMake rewrites the default, since it works, and people get confused ifchanged information doesn't get rewritten automagically
NOT BUG:Move the password reading functions completely away from the DESsectionAdd ui_compath for inclusion by those who want the old functions andprovide all of them, not just the higherlevel ones, in ui_compatc
NOT BUG:Put back a removed "extern", or many compilers will complain aboutredefined variables
NOT BUG:if 0 out deleted ? functions to stop Win32 DLLbuild falling over
NOT BUG:Change Win32 to use EXPORT_VAR_AS_FNFix OPENSSL_IMPLEMENT_GLOBALAllow Win32 to use EXPORT_VAR_AS_FN in mkdefplmake update
NOT BUG:Clarify behaviour with respect to SSL/TLS records
NOT BUG:Under VC++ _DLL is set to indicate that the applicationwill be linked against the DLL runtime library It isautomatically set when /MD is usedAs a result OpenSSL shouldn't use _DLL to determine ifit should set OPENSSL_OPT_WINDLL because this willcause linkage conflicts with static builds which doinclude the /MD compiler switch
NOT BUG:Typo
NOT BUG:e_os2h defines things like OPENSSL_SYS_MSDOS, not opensslconfhbasically: whooops :

NOT BUG:the backslash is significant
NOT BUG:rnd issues
NOT BUG:bctest changes for Ultrix don't return 1 from bctest, otherwise make aborts
NOT BUG:Some platforms most notably Windows do not have a $HOME by defaultFor those, unless the environment variables RANDFILE or HOME aredefined the default case!, RAND_file_name will return NULLThis change adds a default HOME for those platformsTo add a default HOME for any platform, just define DEFAULT_HOME inthe proper place, wrapped in appropriate ifdefendif, in e_osh

NOT BUG:A method to create shared libraries on AIX, and according to"Howard Chu" <hyc@highlandsuncom>, it may be general enoughto work on any Unixly system
NOT BUG:make update
BUG:For some inexplicable reason, I'd a left the debugging irreversiblyturned on, and b left a somewhat curious debugging string in the output
NOT BUG:Some fixes to the referencecounting in ENGINE code First, there were afew statements equivalent to "ENGINE_addENGINE_openssl" etc The innercall to ENGINE_openssl as with other functions like it orphans astructural reference count Second, the ENGINE_cleanup function alsoneeds to clean up the functional reference counts held internally as thelist of "defaults" ie as used when RSA_new requires an appropriateENGINE reference So ENGINE_clear_defaults was created and is calledfrom within ENGINE_cleanup Third, some of the existing code waslogically broken in its treatment of reference counts and locking myfault, so the necessary bits have been restructured and tidied upTo test this stuff, compiling with ENGINE_REF_COUNT_DEBUG will cause everyreference count change both structural and functional to log a message to'stderr' Using with "openssl engine" for example shows this in actionquite well as the 'engine' subcommand cleans up after itself properlyAlso replaced some spaces with tabs
NOT BUG:Make proper use of all disabling variables
NOT BUG:"make update"
NOT BUG:Make notes about ENGINE changes
NOT BUG:Linux shared libraries can be linked with debug symbolsTru64 shared libraries can be linked with static libraries
NOT BUG:make update
NOT BUG:This adds 2 things to the ENGINE code "ex_data"  a CRYPTO_EX_DATA structure in the ENGINE structure itselfthat allows an ENGINE to store its own information there rather than inglobal variables It follows the declarations and implementations usedin RSA code, for better or worse However there's a problem when storingstate with ENGINEs because, unlike related structure types in OpenSSL,there is no ENGINEvsENGINE_METHOD separation Because of what ENGINEis, it has method pointers as its structure elements   which leadsto; ENGINE_FLAGS_BY_ID_COPY  if an ENGINE should not be used just as areference to an "implementation" eg to get to a hardware device, butshould also be able to maintain state, then this flag can be set by theENGINE implementation The result is that any call to ENGINE_by_idwill not result in the existing ENGINE being returned with itsstructural reference count incremented but instead a new copy of theENGINE will be returned that can maintain its own state independantly ofany other copies returned in the past or future Eg keygenerationmight involve a series of ENGINEspecific control commands to setalgorithms, sizes, modulekeys, ids, ACLs, etc A final command couldgenerate the key An ENGINE doing this would have to declareENGINE_FLAGS_BY_ID_COPY so that the state of that process can bemaintained "perhandle" and unaffected by other code having a referenceto the same ENGINE structure
NOT BUG:Clean up ENGINE before exiting
NOT BUG:Provide the possibility to clean up internal ENGINE structures  Thistakes care of what would otherwise be seen as a memory leak
BUG:gcc warns when certain values of an enumeration aren't taken care of,unless there's a default clause
NOT BUG:Check for OPENSSL_NO_RSA, OPENSSL_NO_DSA and OPENSSL_NO_DH and disableappropriate code if any of them is defined
NOT BUG:engineh includes all the needed header files, so don't do it againhere
NOT BUG:We shouldn't skip over header files to avoid functions of disabled algorithms  The selection is done in a different way
BUG:User OPENSSL_UNISTD instead of <unistdh>Spotted by Mark Crispin <MRC@PandaCOM>

NOT BUG:Script to create shareable images shared libraries in Unixly termson VMS
NOT BUG:VMS was behind when it comes to OCSP
NOT BUG:Add notes about the new ENGINE functionality
NOT BUG:Changes to "openssl engine" to support the new control command code inENGINE Extra verbosity can be added with more "v"'s, eg 'vvv' givesinformation about input flags and descriptions for each control commandin each ENGINE Check the output of "openssl engine vvv" for example 'pre <cmd>' and 'post <cmd>' can be used to invoke control commands onthe specified ENGINE or on all of them if no engine id is specified,although that usually gets pretty ugly 'post' commands are onlyattempted if 't' is specified and the engine successfully initialises'pre' commands are always attempted whether or not 't' causes aninitialisation to be tried afterwards Multiple 'pre' and/or 'post'commands can be specified and they will be called in the order theyoccur on the command lineParameterised commands the normal case, there are currently nounparameterised ones are split into command and argument via a separatingcolon Eg "openssl engine pre SO_PATH:/lib/libdriverso <id>" results inthe call;ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_stringe, "SO_PATH", "/lib/libdriverso", 0;Application code should similarly allow arbitrary namevalue string pairsto be passed into ENGINEs in a manner matching that in apps/enginec,either using the same colonseparated format, or entered as two distinctstrings Eg as stored in a registry The last parameter ofENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string can be changed from 0 to 1 if the command shouldonly be attempted if it's supported by the specified ENGINE eg forcommands like "FORK_CHECK:1" that may or may not apply to the runtimeENGINE
NOT BUG:Some more tweaks to ENGINE codeThis change adds some basic control commands to the existing ENGINEsexcept the software 'openssl' engine All these engines currently loadsharedlibraries for hardware APIs, so they've all been given "SO_PATH"commands that will configure the chosen ENGINE to load its shared libraryfrom the given path Eg by calling;ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_stringe, "SO_PATH", <path>, 0The nCipher 'chil' ENGINE has also had "FORK_CHECK" and "THREAD_LOCKING"commands added so these settings could be handled via applicationlevelconfiguration rather than in application source codeChanges to "openssl engine" to test and examine these control commands willbe made shortly It will also provide the necessary tips to applicationprograms wanting to support these dynamic control commands
NOT BUG:Some BIG tweaks to ENGINE codeThis change adds some new functionality to the ENGINE code and API tomake it possible for ENGINEs to describe and implement their own controlcommands that can be interrogated and used by calling applications atruntime The source code includes numerous comments explaining how it allworks and some of the finer details But basically, an ENGINE will normallydeclare an array of ENGINE_CMD_DEFN entries in its ENGINE  and the variousnew ENGINE_CTRL_ command types take care of iterating through this listof definitions, converting command numbers to names, command names tonumbers, getting descriptions, getting input flags, etc Theseadministrative commands are handled directly in the base ENGINE code ratherthan in each ENGINE's ctrl handler, unless they specify theENGINE_FLAGS_MANUAL_CMD_CTRL flag ie if they're doing something clever ordynamic with the command definitionsThere is also a new function, ENGINE_cmd_is_executable, that willdetermine if an ENGINE control command is of an "executable" type thatcan be used in another new function, ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string If not, thecontrol command is not supposed to be exposed out to user/config levelaccess  eg it could involve the exchange of binary data, returningresults to calling code, etc etc If the command is executable thenENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string can be called using a name/arg string pair Thecontrol command's input flags will be used to determine necessaryconversions before the control command is called, and commands of thisform will always return zero or one failure or success, respectivelyThis is set up so that arbitrary applications can support control commandsin a consistent way so that tweaking particular ENGINE behaviour isspecific to the ENGINE and the host environment, and independant of theapplication or OpenSSLSome code demonstrating this stuff in action will applied shortly to thevarious ENGINE implementations, as well as "openssl engine" support forexecuting arbitrary control commands before and/or after initialisingvarious ENGINEs
NOT BUG:Some more tweaks to ENGINE codeThe existing ENGINEs including the default 'openssl' software engine werestatic, declared inside the source file for each engine implementation Thereason this was not going boom was that all the ENGINEs had referencecounts that never hit zero once linked into the internal list, each wouldalways have at least 1 lasting structural referenceTo fix this so it will stay standing when an "unload" function is added tomatch ENGINE_load_builtin_engines, the "constructor" functions for eachENGINE implementation have been changed to dynamically allocate andconstruct their own ENGINEs using API functions The other benefit of thisis that no ENGINE implementation has to include the internal "engine_inth"header file any more
NOT BUG:Make a note of the recent ENGINE developments
NOT BUG:typo
NOT BUG:fix md_randc locking bugs
NOT BUG:Make the shared library name and function symbol for the "nuron" ENGINEstatic data where they could be parameterised by ctrl commands
NOT BUG:Some more tweaks from ENGINE codePreviously RAND_get_rand_method was returning a nonconst pointer, but itshould be const As with all other such cases, METHOD pointers are stored andreturned as "const" The only methods one should be able to alter are methods"local" to the relevant code, in which case a nonconst handle to the methodsshould already existThis change has been forced by the constifying of the ENGINE code beforewhich RAND_METHOD was the only method pointer in an ENGINE structure that wasnot constant
NOT BUG:Some more tweaks to ENGINE codeENGINE handler functions should take the ENGINE structure as a parameter this is because ENGINE structures can be copied, and like otherstructure/method setups in OpenSSL, it should be possible for init,finish, ctrl, etc to adjust state inside the ENGINE structures ratherthan globally This commit includes the dependant changes in the ENGINEimplementations
NOT BUG:Some more tweaks to ENGINE codePrevious changes permanently removed the commentedout old code for whereit was possible to create and use an ENGINE statically, and this code getsrid of the ENGINE_FLAGS_MALLOCED flag that supported the distinction withdynamically allocated ENGINEs It also moves the area for ENGINE_FLAGS_values from engine_inth to engineh  because it should be possible todeclare ENGINEs just from declarations in exported headers
NOT BUG:Some more tweaks to ENGINE code Constify the get/set functions, and add some that functions were missing Add a new 'ENGINE_cpy' function that will produce a new ENGINE basedcopied from an original except for the references, ie the new copy willbe like an ENGINE returned from 'ENGINE_new'  a structural reference Removed the "null parameter" checking in the get/set functions  it islegitimate to set NULL values as a way of changing an ENGINE ieremoving a handler that previously existed Also, passing a NULL pointerfor an ENGINE is obviously wrong for these functions, so don't botherchecking for it The result is a number of error codes and strings couldbe removed
NOT BUG:Structural references should never be decremented directly  so leave thatto ENGINE_free Also, remove "if 0" code that has no useful future
NOT BUG:This moves string constants out of vendor headers and into C files

NOT BUG:Sort platforms lexicographically as well  Also, support more than twovariants of a symbol
NOT BUG:Spelling corrected
NOT BUG:Introduce the possibility to access global variables throughfunctions on platform were that's the best way to handle exportingglobal variables in shared libraries  To enable this functionality,one must configure with "EXPORT_VAR_AS_FN" or defined the C macro"OPENSSL_EXPORT_VAR_AS_FUNCTION" in crypto/opensslconfh the latteris normally done by Configure or something similarTo implement a global variable, use the macro OPENSSL_IMPLEMENT_GLOBALin the source file fooc like this:OPENSSL_IMPLEMENT_GLOBALint,foo1;OPENSSL_IMPLEMENT_GLOBALdouble,bar;To declare a global variable, use the macros OPENSSL_DECLARE_GLOBALand OPENSSL_GLOBAL_REF in the header file fooh like this:OPENSSL_DECLARE_GLOBALint,foo;define foo OPENSSL_GLOBAL_REFfooOPENSSL_DECLARE_GLOBALdouble,bar;define bar OPENSSL_GLOBAL_REFbarThe defines are very important, and therefore so is including theheader file everywere where the defined globals are usedThe macro OPENSSL_EXPORT_VAR_AS_FUNCTION also affects the definitionof ASN1 items, but that structure is a bt differentThe largest change is in util/mkdefpl which has been enhanced withbetter and easier to understand logic to choose which symbols shouldgo into the Windows def files as well as a number of fixes and codecleanup among others, algorithm keywords are now sortedlexicographically to avoid constant rewrites

BUG:autoconf would be useful
NOT BUG:Make OCSP cert id code tolerate a missing issuer certificateor serial number

NOT BUG:I missed one
NOT BUG:Fix an oversight  when checking a potential session ID for conflicts withan SSL_CTX's session cache, it is necessary to compare the ssl_version atthe same time a conflict is defined, courtesy of SSL_SESSION_cmp, as amatching id/id_length pair and a matching ssl_version However, theSSL_SESSION that will result from the current negotiation does notnecessarily have the same ssl version as the "SSL_METHOD" in use by theSSL_CTX  part of the work in a handshake is to agree on an ssl version!This is fixed by having the check function accept an SSL pointer ratherthan the SSL_CTX it belongs to[Thanks to Lutz for illuminating the full extent of my stupidity]
NOT BUG:Define the right macro for Linux and other GNUbased systems to get a correct declaration of strdup
BUG:e_osh defines Getenv
NOT BUG:CONF_METHOD is one of the few places where you find MS_FAR  I can'treally see why we need to define these function pointers with MS_FARif it's not done cosistently everywhereIf we decide to support MS_FAR modifiers, it's better to have thenamed something more unique for OpenSSL and to define them in e_os2h
NOT BUG:Define the OPENSSL_NO_ macros as NO_ macros for the sake of applications thathaven't yet been changed
NOT BUG:e_osh problems have been solved in the main branch
NOT BUG:undo previous change: "e_osh" is now the official name for the fileto include but the OpenSSL_0_9_6stable branche still hasinconsistencies
NOT BUG:include e_osh as "openssl/e_osh" as elsewhere
NOT BUG:e_osh does not belong with the exported headers  Do not put it thereand make all files the depend on it include it without prefixing itwith openssl/This means that all Makefiles will have $TOP as one of the includedirectories
NOT BUG:Since RAND_file_name uses strlen, make sure the number that'scompared to it has the type size_t  Included the needed headers tomake that happen
NOT BUG:Use e_os2h rather than opensslconfh, since some needed macros aredefined there
NOT BUG:Exported header files should not include e_osh
NOT BUG:Since opensslconfh might be included over and over, undefineOPENSSL_UNISTD before redefining it, to avoid compiler warnings
BUG:One indirection level too little compared to thepreCRYPTO_MEM_LEAK_CB time
NOT BUG:Windows does not know of strigsh or strcasecmp, so when in Windows,make strcasecmp a macro to _stricmp
NOT BUG:Always include opensslconfh, even if it's already been done beforeThe reason is that some parts are only included when certain otherinclude files have been includedAlso, it seems that the rest of the OpenSSL code assumes that allkinds of M$ Windows are MSDOS as well
NOT BUG:When inside a if 0endif, do not define anything
NOT BUG:Since SSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack isn't impemented on VMS,there's no point creating an alias for it
NOT BUG:Include e_os2h instead of opensslconfhSSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack is not implemented on WIN32 andVMS, so declare it the same way
NOT BUG:Rebuild ASN1 error codes to remove unused function and reason codes
NOT BUG:If a callback is generating a new session ID for SSLv2, then upon exiting,the ID will be padded out to 16 bytes if the callback attempted to generatea shorter one The problem is that the uniqueness checking function used incallbacks may mistakenly think a 9byte ID is unique when in fact itspadded 16byte version is not This makes the checking function detectSSLv2 cases, and ensures the padded form is checked rather than the shorterone passed by the callback
NOT BUG:Note changes re: session ID generation callbacks, etc
NOT BUG:This adds commandline support to s_server for controlling the generationof session IDs Namely, passing "id_prefix <text>" will set agenerate_session_id callback that generates session IDs as random datawith <text> blockcopied over the top of the start of the ID This can beviewed by watching the session ID s_client's output when it connectsThis is mostly useful for testing any SSL/TLS code eg proxies that wishto deal with multiple servers, when each of which might be generating aunique range of session IDs eg with a certain prefix
NOT BUG:This change allows a callback to be used to override the generation ofSSL/TLS session IDs in a server According to RFC2246, the session ID is anarbitrary value chosen by the server It can be useful to have some controlover this "arbitrary value" so as to choose it in ways that can aid inthings like external session caching and balancing eg clustering Thedefault session ID generation is to fill the ID with random dataThe callback used by default is built in to ssl_sessc, but registering acallback in an SSL_CTX or in a particular SSL overrides this BTW: SSLcallbacks will override SSL_CTX callbacks, and a new SSL structure inheritsany callback set in its 'parent' SSL_CTX The header comments describe howthis mechanism ticks, and source code comments describe hopefully why itticks the way it doesMan pages are on the way [NB: Lutz was also hacking away and helping me to figure out how best to dothis]

BUG:Modify mkdefpl to recognise and parse prprocessor conditionals of theform 'if defined || defined || ' and 'if !defined&& !defined && '  This also avoids the growing number ofspecial cases it was previously handling some of them wrongly
NOT BUG:I had forgotten to change mkerrpl to use the new macro system
BUG:strdup is a X/Open extension
NOT BUG:With later version of DEC C on VMS, some functions strcmp, forexample are declared with some extra linkage information  Thisgenerates a warning when using the function name as a value to aregular function pointer with the "correct" definition of thefunction  Therefore, use a macro to cast the appropriate function onVMS
NOT BUG:Some functions, like strdup and strcasecmp, are defined instringsh according to X/Open
NOT BUG:I forgot there was a reason why the inclusions and definition of u_intwas made in a certain sequence  This change restores the earlier"chain of command"
NOT BUG:OpenVMS catches up
NOT BUG:The callbacks in the NAME_FUNCS structure are not used directly as LHASHcallbacks, and their prototypes were consistent as they were These castsneed reversingAlso, I personally find line breaks during parameter lists ie a lineending in a comma easier to read at a glance than line breaks at the endof a function call and before a dereference on the return value ie a lineending in a closedbracket followed by a line starting with ">"

NOT BUG:This change was a quick experiment that I'd wanted to try that works quitewell and is a good demonstration of how encapsulating the SSL in amemorybased state machine can make it easier to apply to differentsituationsThe change implements a new commandline switch "flipped <0|1>" which, ifset to 1, reverses the usual interpretation of a client and server for SSLtunneling Normally, an ssl client ie "server 0" accepts "cleartext"connections and conducts SSL/TLS over a proxied connection acting as an SSLclient Likewise, an ssl server ie "server 1" accepts connections andconducts SSL/TLS as an SSL server over them and passes "cleartext" overthe proxied connection With "flipped 1", an SSL client specified with"server 0" in fact accepts SSL connections and proxies clear, whereas anSSL server "server 1" accepts clear and proxies SSL NB: most of thisdiff is commandline handling, the actual meat of the change is simply theline or two that plugs "clean" and "dirty" file descriptors into the itemthat holds the statemachine  reverse them and you get the desiredbehaviourThis allows a network server to be an SSL client, and a network client tobe an SSL server Apart from curiosity value, there's a couple of possiblyinteresting applications  SSL/TLS is inherently vulnerable to trivial DoSattacks, because the SSL server usually has to perform a private keyoperation first, even if the client is authenticated With this scenario,the network client is the SSL server and performs the first private keyoperation, whereas the network server serves as the SSL client Anotherpossible application is when clientonly authentication is required iethe underlying protocol handles or doesn't care about authenticating theserver Eg an SSL/TLS version of 'ssh' could be concocted where theclient's signed certificate is used to validate login to a server system whether or not the client needs to validate who the server is can beconfigured at the client end rather than at the server end ie a completeinversion of what happens in normal SSL/TLSNB: This is just an experiment/plaything, using "flipped 1" probablycreates something that is interoperable with exactly nothing :

NOT BUG:Add automatic query of EGD sockets to RAND_poll The EGD sockets areonly queried when the /dev/[u]random devices did not return enoughentropy Only the amount of entropy missing to reach the required minimumis queried, as EGD may be drainedQueried locations are: /etc/entropy, /var/run/egdpool
NOT BUG:It was correctly pointed out to me that my CHANGES entry was a little thinon details :
NOT BUG:Don't cheat: when only getting several bytes from each source, n is incrementedcorrectly, but RAND_add,n counts the increasing n several timesOnly RAND_add,n once entropy collection is finished
NOT BUG:Move all the existing function pointer casts associated with LHASH's two"doall" functions to using typesafe wrappers As and where required, thiscan be replaced by redeclaring the underlying callbacks to use theunderlying "void"based prototypes eg if performance suffers from anextra level of function invocation
NOT BUG:Get rid of the function pointer casting in the debugging memory code dueto LHASH usage NB: The callback type used as been suctioned off intocryptoh as CRYPTO_MEM_LEAK_CB to improve clarity
NOT BUG:This adds macros to implement and/or declare typesafe wrapper functionsaround the callbacks required in the LHASH code for the "doall" functionsAlso  fix the evil function pointer casting in the two lh_doall functionsby deferring to a static utility function Previously lh_doall wasinvoking lh_doall_arg by casting the callback to the 2parameterprototype and passing in a NULL argument This appears to have been workingthus far but it's not a hot idea If the extra level of indirection becomesa performance hit, we can just provide two virtually identicalimplementations for each variant later on
NOT BUG:Whilst in the process of fixing outstanding functionpointer casts in theLHASH code, this evil was uncovered The cast was obscuring the fact thatthe function was prototyped to take 2 parameters when in fact it is beingused as a callback that should take only one Anyway, the function itselfignores the second parameter thankfully A proper cure is on the way butfor now this corrects the inconsistency
NOT BUG:Keep up with Unix code  It's beginning to be  time to rethink the VMSbuild system
NOT BUG:Because /dev/urandom has a better chance of giving us a good andquick answer, take that one first
NOT BUG:Add prototypes for new OCSP functionsFix bug in OCSP_find_status
NOT BUG:Change RAND_poll for Unix to try a number of devices and only readthem for a short period of time actually, poll them with select,then read whatever is there, which is about 10ms hardcoded valueeachSeparate Windows and Unixly code, and start on a VMS variant thatcurrently just returns 0

NOT BUG:Update OCSP APIRemove extensions argument from various functionsbecause it is not needed with the new extensioncodeNew function OCSP_cert_to_id to convert a pairof certificates into an OCSP_CERTIDNew simple OCSP HTTP function This is rather primitivebut just about adequate to send OCSP requests andparse the responseFix typo in CRL distribution points extensionFix ASN1 code so it adds a final null to constructedstrings
NOT BUG:Fix the S/MIME code so it now works again anduses the new ASN1 code
NOT BUG:Make the DSO code for VMS work again  First attempt
NOT BUG:The option line may start with a space, which gives an empty optionMake sure those are purged
NOT BUG:Look for nokrb5 and add the definition of NO_KRB5 if it's thereI've no idea were the KRB5 header files and libraries are placed onWin32  When there's better knowledge, we might be able to process theother KRB5related arguments as well
NOT BUG:Temporary measure: if no KRB5 is defined, add "nokrb5" to theoptions  This is so mk1mfpl can pick it up from Makefile
NOT BUG:Since asn1h gets included recursively from many places, the easiestis to have asn1h include e_osh and e_os2h  Of course, this makesthe unofficial "nonexport" status of e_osh a bit delicate
NOT BUG:Rewrite PKCS12 code and remove some of the oldhorrible macrosFix two evil ASN1 bugs Attempt to use 'ctx' whenNULL if input is indefinite length constructedin asn1_check_tlen and invalid pointer to ASN1_TYPEwhen reusing existing structure this took ages tofind because the new PKCS12 code triggered it
NOT BUG:Remove RSArefrelated things
NOT BUG:Document
NOT BUG:If OPENSSL_BUILD_SHLIBCRYPTO for files that end up as libcryptoobjects or OPENSSL_BUILD_SHLIBSSL for files that end up as libsslobjects is defined, redefine OPENSSL_EXTERN to be OPENSSL_EXPORTThis is actually only important on Win32, and can safely be ignored inall other cases, at least for now
NOT BUG:Define OPENSSL_EXPORT and OPENSSL_IMPORT and give OPENSSL_EXTERN thedefault value OPENSSL_IMPORT  Explain the use of all those macros
NOT BUG:Remove anything connected to RSAref, since that's gone by nowAdd the C macros OPENSSL_BUILD_SHLIBCRYPTO and OPENSSL_BUILD_SHLIBSSLto the build of the object files as appropriate for each library
BUG:Uhmm, the keyword TRUE does not exist of course
NOT BUG:Delete PKCS12 redundant files
NOT BUG:ASN1_ITEM versions of ASN1_d2i_{fp, bio} and replacement ofmost of the old wrappers A few of the old versions remainbecause they are non standard and the corresponding ASN1code has not been reimplemented yet

NOT BUG:This adds support to 'tunala' for supplying DH parameters without which itwill not support EDH cipher suites The parameters can either be loadedfrom a file via "dh_file", generated by the application on startup"dh_special generate", or be standard DH parameters as used ins_server, etc
NOT BUG:Some minor changes to the "tunala" demo Seal off some buffer functions so that only the higherlevel IO functionsare exposed Using the above change to buffer, add support to tunala for displayingtraffic totals when a tunnel closes Useful in debugging and analysis you get to see the total encrypted traffic versus the total tunneledtraffic This shows not only how much expansion your data suffers fromSSL a lot if you send/receive a few bytes at a time, but also theoverhead of SSL handshaking relative to the payload sent through thetunnel This is controlled by the "out_totals" switch to tunala Fix and tweak some bits in the READMEEg sample output of "out_totals" from a tunnel client when tunneling a brief"telnet" sessionTunnel closing, traffic stats followSSL network traffic to/from server;     7305 bytes in,     3475 bytes outtunnelled data to/from server;            4295 bytes in,      186 bytes out

NOT BUG:Add OCSP nonce extension to supported extensionsThis is a little unusual because it can contain nostructure ie the extension OCTET STRING contentoctets do not contain a DER encoded structure
NOT BUG:Make a note of the new engine
NOT BUG:This is an engine contributed by Broadcom  it is meant to support theBCM5805 and BCM5820 units So far I've merely taken a skim over the codeand changed a few things from their original contributed sourcedeshadowing variables, removing variables from the header, andreconstifying some functions to remove warnings If this givescompilation problems on any system, please let me know We will hopefullyknow for sure whether this actually functions on a system with the relevanthardware in a day or two  :

NOT BUG:Don't throw away bctest's error messages
NOT BUG:Test for SCO bc bug
NOT BUG:Next step in tidying up the LHASH codeDECLARE/IMPLEMENT macros now exist to create type and prototype safewrapper functions that avoid the use of function pointer casting yet retaintypesafety for typespecific callbacks However, most of the usage withinOpenSSL itself doesn't really require the extra function because the hashand compare callbacks are internal functions declared only for use by thehash table So this change catches all those cases and reimplements thefunctions using the baselevel LHASH prototypes and does pervariablecasting inside those functions to convert to the appropriate item typeThe exception so far is in ssl_libc where the hash and compare callbacksare not static  they're exposed in sslh so their prototypes should not bechanged In this last case, the IMPLEMENT_LHASH_ macros have been leftintact
NOT BUG:bn_part_sub_word prototype
NOT BUG:Merge from the ASN1 branch of new ASN1 codeto main trunkLets see if the makes it to opensslcvs :
NOT BUG:Add manual pages for certficate/key loading and friends
NOT BUG:Placeholder for SCO bc bug detection

NOT BUG:Change error message to "bignum too long"
NOT BUG:Sync up with a minor change in lhashh
NOT BUG:ANSI C doesn't allow trailing semicolons after a function's closing braceso these macros probably shouldn't be used like that at all So, thischange removes the misleading comment and also adds an implicit trailingsemicolon to the DECLARE macros so they too don't require one
NOT BUG:Update the documentation to the current state of the LHASH changes Therewill probably be more when the lh_doall[_arg] callbacks are similarlytidied up, but this 'pod' should now be current
NOT BUG:Make a note of the LHASH changes
NOT BUG:Make the remaining LHASH macro changes This should leave no remainingcases of function pointer casting in lh_new calls  and leave only thelh_doall and lh_doall_arg cases to be finished
NOT BUG:Fix warnings
NOT BUG:include <limitsh>
NOT BUG:Don't allow BIGNUMs to become so large that computations with dmaxmight overflow
NOT BUG:Use the new LHASH macros to declare typesafe wrapper functions that canbe used as the hash/compare callbacks without function pointer castingFor now, this is just happening in the apps/ directory whilst a few peoplecheck the approach The rest of the library will be moved across to thesame idea if there's no problems with this
NOT BUG:Next step in tidying up the LHASH code This commit defines DECLARE andIMPLEMENT macros for defining wrapper functions for "hash" and "cmp" callbacksthat are specific to the underlying item type in a hashtable This preventsfunction pointer casting altogether, and also provides some typesafetybecause the macro does pervariable casting from the void  type used inLHASH itself to the type declared in the macro  and if that doesn't match theprototype expected by the "hash" or "cmp" function then a compiler error willresultNB: IMPLEMENT macros are not required unless predeclared forms are requiredeither in a header file, or further up in a C file than the implementationneeds to be The DECLARE macros must occur after the typespecific hash/cmpcallbacks are declared Also, the IMPLEMENT and DECLARE macros are such thatthey can be prefixed with "static" if desired and a trailing semicolon shouldbe appended making it look more like a regular declaration and easier onautoformatting texteditors tooNow that these macros are defined, I will next be commiting changes to anumber of places in the library where the casting was doing bad things Afterthat, the final step will be to make the analogous changes for the lh_doalland lh_doall_arg functions more specifically, their callback parameters

NOT BUG:forgot to remove the loop variable
BUG:Loops like this one:if bp  NULLfor j0; j<10000; j++BN_add&c,&a,&b;seem to be pretty useless, and bp never is NULL anyway
NOT BUG:Move the rijndael "test" to the bf and cast tests
NOT BUG:Note the bntest changeThe _part_words functions are not static
NOT BUG:New function BN_bntest_rand to detect more BN library bugsThe bn_cmp_part_words bug was only caught in the BN_mod_mul test,not in the BN_mul test, so apparently the choice of parameters insome cases is bad
NOT BUG:Fix bn_cmp_part_words and move it to bn_libc
NOT BUG:remove unused static function
NOT BUG:First step in tidying up the LHASH code The callback prototypes andcasts used in the lhash code are about as horrible and evil as they canbe For starters, the callback prototypes contain empty parameter listsYuckThis first change defines clearer prototypes  including "typedef"'dfunction pointer types to use as "hash" and "compare" callbacks, as well asthe callbacks passed to the lh_doall and lh_doall_arg iteration functionsNow at least more explicit and clear casting is required in all of thedependant code  and that should be included in this commitThe next step will be to hunt down and obliterate some of the functionpointer casting being used when it's not necessary  a particularly evilvariant exists in the implementation of lh_doall

NOT BUG: Fix a slight bug in the statemachine This caused the client end of atunnel to not proactively close down when failing an SSL handshake Change the certchain callback  originally this was the same one used ins_client and s_server but the output's as ugly as sin, so I've prettiedtunala's copy output up a bit and made the output level configurable Remove the superfluous "errors" from the SSL state callback  these are justnonblocking sideeffects

NOT BUG:More little changes to the tunala demo; A little bit of codecleanup Reformat the usage string not so wide Allow adding an alternative usually DSA cert/key pair a la s_server Allow control over certchain verify depth
NOT BUG:BN_to_montgomery expects its inputs to be in the interval 0  modulus1,so we have to reduce the random numbers used in test_montBefore this change, test_mont failed in [debug]solarissparcv9gccconfigurations "Montgomery multiplication test failed!" becausethe multiplication result obtained with Montgomery multiplicationdiffered from the result obtained by BN_mod_mulSubstituing the old version of bn_gcdc BN_mod_inverse did not avoidthe problemThe strange thing is that it I did not observe any problemswhen using debugsolarissparcv8gcc and solarissparcv9cc,as well as when compiling OpenSSL 096 in the solaricsparcv9gccconfiguration on the same system

NOT BUG:use standard C
NOT BUG:Minor tweaks and improvements to the tunala demo Add "cipher" and "out_state" command line arguments to control SSLciphersuites and handshake debug output respectively Implemented error handling for SSL handshakes that break down This usesa cheat  storing a nonNULL pointer as "app_data" in the SSL structurewhen the SSL should be killed

NOT BUG:It was a small change, but it could conceivably affect people  so I'mmaking a note in the CHANGES file
NOT BUG:Ensure that the "ex_data" member of an RSA structure is initialised beforethe RSA_METHOD's "init" handler is called, and is cleaned up after theRSA_METHOD's "finish" handler is called Custom RSA_METHODs may wish toinitialise contexts and other specifics in the RSA structure upon creationand that was previously not possible  "ex_data" is where that stuffshould go and it was being initialised too late for it to be used

NOT BUG:Make sure bs is assigned NULL when it's free'd, or there will be anincorrect attempt to free it once more
NOT BUG:I wonder if I do too much
NOT BUG:Add news items early  Please fill in with what I have forgotten
NOT BUG:Remove two bn_wexpand from BN_mul, which is a step toward gettingBN_mul correctly constified, avoids two realloc's that aren'treally necessary and saves memory to boot  This required a smallchange in bn_mul_part_recursive and the addition of variants ofbn_cmp_words, bn_add_words and bn_sub_words that can take arrayswith differing sizesThe test results show a performance that very closely matches theoriginal code from before my constification  This may seem like avery small win from a performance point of view, but if one remembersthat the variants of bn_cmp_words, bn_add_words and bn_sub_wordsare not at all optimized for the moment and there's no correspondingassembler code, and that their use may be just as nonoptimal, I'mpretty confident there are possibilitiesThis code needs reviewing!

NOT BUG:I might want to debug the assembler modules
BUG:Increase permissible ClientKeyExchange message length

NOT BUG:More constification of the BN library
NOT BUG:Make sure to print the BN counting BN_COUNT to stderr instead ofstdout  bc gets so confused by bean counts
BUG:Oops, when I clean, I should do it thoroughly
NOT BUG:I've checked again and again  There really is no need to expand a to4 times it's size when bn_sqr_recursive won't look farther than theoriginal length  Thereby, constification is no longer a problem
NOT BUG:/proc/cpuinfo can have several lines containing the word "type"  We want the one that is "type", plain and simple  Caught by Raoul Borenius <borenius@shuttlede>
NOT BUG:I have no idea how this comment got there, but it's certainly notapplicable to ENGINE_ctrl
NOT BUG:Many applications that use OpenSSL with ENGINE support might face asituation where they've initialised the ENGINE, loaded keys which are thenlinked to that ENGINE, and performed other checks such as verifyingcertificate chains etc At that point, if the application goesmultithreaded or multiprocess it creates problems for any ENGINEimplementations that are either not thread/process safe or that performoptimally when they do not have to perform locking and other contentionmanagement tasks at "runtime"This defines a new ENGINE_ctrl command that can be supported by enginesat their discretion If ENGINE_ctrl, ENGINE_CTRL_HUP, returns anerror then the caller should check if the _R_COMMAND_NOT_IMPLEMENTED errorreason was set  it may just be that the engine doesn't support or need theHUP command, or it could be that the attempted reinitialisation failed Acrude alternative is to ignore the return value from ENGINE_ctrl andclear any errors with ERR_clear_error and perform a test operationimmediately after the "HUP" Very crude indeedENGINEs can support this command to close and reopen connections, files,handles, or whatever as an alternative to runtime locking when such thingswould otherwise be needed In such a case, it's advisable for the engineimplementations to support locking by default but disable it after thearrival of a HUP command, or any other indication by the application thatlocking is not required NB: This command exists to allow an ENGINE toreinitialise without the ENGINE's functional reference count having to sinkdown to zero and back up  which is what is normally required for thefinish and init handlers to get invoked It would also be a bad ideafor engine_lib to catch this command itself and interpret it by calling theengine's init and finish handlers directly, because reinitialisationmay need special handling on a casebycase basis that is distinct from afinish/init pair  eg calling a finish handler may invalidate the statestored inside individual keys that have already loaded for this engine
NOT BUG:Fill in missing information about the string returned fromSSL_CIPHER_description, as there is no other API function to findout details about the cipher used besides the number of bits or protocol used
NOT BUG:ignore
NOT BUG:Modify  to void, since that's what is actually defined in theengine structure, and some ANSI C compilers will complain otherwise
NOT BUG:Two OCSP functions that aren't yet implemented
NOT BUG:make update
NOT BUG:Get the Rijndael function declarations
NOT BUG:Detect and mark functions that no longer exist
NOT BUG:Some platforms namely HPUX require the 'x' bit set for shared librariesFor performance reasons, it is also recommended to make the mmap'edshared library 'readonly'> New permissions for installed shared libraries  555This doesn't hurt anybody, provided the installation is performed with'cp f' :
NOT BUG:Typo, was "time" instead of "tim"Caught by Jeffrey Altman <jaltman@columbiaedu>
NOT BUG:Add Rijndael as things to look through
NOT BUG:HPUX shared libraries do not build any longer, as EX_LIBS contains"Wl,+s" instead of +s: Hardcoded necessary references to ldld/ldl into the build rules andremoved EX_LIBSHPUX records the pathnames of dependent libraries when the shared libsare built, so that /libcryptosl is recorded in libsslsl, with"/" not being resolvable when running an application linked against lssl: Build libssl without explicit reference to libcrypto, applications willbe linked with "lssl lcrypto" anywayDocument these informations in Makefileorg
NOT BUG:in some new file names the first 8 characters were not unique
NOT BUG:For a long time, I've wanted to be able to easily run one or a fewindividual tests  I finally got myself to implement it

NOT BUG:Handle BN_copy failure after successful BN_new
NOT BUG:handle the case when BN_new returns NULL
NOT BUG:Document recent constifications
NOT BUG:Constification of CRYPTO_get_ex_data needed for the sake ofRSA_get_ext_data

NOT BUG:Constify the RSAref glue code
NOT BUG:Constify the RSA parts of the ASN1 library  Note some ugly caststhat are needed in the ASN1 macros  Hopefully, we can get rid ofthose in an elegant way in the future
NOT BUG:Constify the RSA library
NOT BUG:Constify the RSA library
NOT BUG:As a consequence of the BIGNUM constification, the ENGINE code needs afew small constifying changes, and why not throw in a couple of extraswhile I'm at it?
NOT BUG:Make all engines available in the openssl application
NOT BUG:looks like a cut&paste error
NOT BUG:Constify the BIGNUM routines a bit more  The only trouble were thetwo functions that did expansion on in parameters BN_mul andBN_sqr  The problem was solved by making bn_dup_expand which isa mix of bn_expand2 and BN_dup
NOT BUG:mode used too early in EVP_PKEY_save_parametersSpotted by Ken Lalonde <ken@torusca>
NOT BUG:Make sure that shared libraries get the internal name engine with thefull version number and not just 0  This should mark the sharedlibraries as not backward compatible  Of course, this should bechanged again when we can guarantee backward binary compatibility

NOT BUG:'openssl engine' can now list engine capabilities  The currentimplementation is contained in the application, and the capabilitystring building part should really be part of the engine libraryThis is therefore an experimental hack, and will be changed in thenear future

NOT BUG:Add a note about the recent DSO changes in CHANGES
NOT BUG:On HPUX, at least when shl_ are used, the libraries have theextension sl instead of so
NOT BUG:For the operating systems where it matters, it is sometimes good totranslate library names by only adding "so" to them withoutprepending them with "lib"  Add the flag DSO_FLAG_NAME_TRANSLATION_EXT_ONLYfor that purpose
NOT BUG:This changes the behaviour of the DSO mechanism for determining anappropriate filename translation on the host system Apart from this point,users should also note that there's a slight change in the API functionstoo The DSO now contains its own tobeconverted filename"dso>filename", and at the time the DSO loads the "dso>loaded_filename"value is set to the translated form As such, this also provides an impicitway of determining if the DSO is currently loaded or not Except, perhaps,VMS  :The various DSO_METHODs have been updated for this mechanism except VMSwhich is deliberately broken for now, Richard is going to look at how tofit it in the source comments in there explain "the issue"Basically, the new callback scheme allows the filename conversion toa be turned off altogether through the use of theDSO_FLAG_NO_NAME_TRANSLATION flag,b be handled in the default way using the default DSO_METHOD's converterc overriden perDSO by setting the override callbackd a mix of b and c  eg implement an override callback that;i checks if we're win32 "ifstrstrdso>meth>name, "win32""and if so, convert "blah" into "blah32dll" the default isotherwise to make it "blahdll"ii default to the normal behaviour  eg we're not on win32, sofinish with return dso>meth>dso_name_converterdso,NULLe be retried a number of times by writing a new DSO_METHOD where the"dso_load" handler will call the converter repeatedly Then thecustom converter could use state information in the DSO to suggestdifferent conversions or paths each time it is invoked

NOT BUG:AIX doesn't like ftime either
NOT BUG:Wrong variable used  It's funny how some bugs take a long timegetting triggered
NOT BUG:On VMS, stdout may very well lead to a file that is written to in arecordoriented fashion  That means that every write will write aseparate record, which will be read separately by the programs tryingto read from it  This can be very confusingThe solution is to put a BIO filter in the way that will buffer textuntil a linefeed is reached, and then write everything a line at atime, so every record written will be an actual line, not chunks oflines and not usually doesn't happen, but I've seen it once severallines in one record  Voila, BIO_f_linebuffer is bornSince we're so close to release time, I'm making this VMSonly fornow, just to make sure no code is needlessly broken by this  Afterthe release, this BIO method will be enabled on all other platforms aswell

NOT BUG:Jeffrey Altman <jaltman@columbiaedu> sent me a patch that fixes theproblems with GetCursorInfo, but also adds network statistics andperformance statistics where available
NOT BUG:Use sk__new_null instead of sk__newNULL, since that takes careof complaints from the compiler about data pointers and functionpointers not being compatible with each other
NOT BUG:siglen is unsigned, so comparing it to less than 0 is silly, andgenerates a compiler warning with Compaq C
NOT BUG:Oops, no engine in the main trunk

NOT BUG:Add docs for BIO_find_type and friendsAdded function BIO_next otherwise you can'ttraverse a chain without accessing BIO internals
NOT BUG:'make update'
NOT BUG:num rewitten to include the extra information
NOT BUG:Major hack of mkdefpl  There should be no more need to redo theprocess when some symbols are missing  Instead, all needed info issaved in the num files, including what conditions are needed for aspecific symbol to existThis was needed for the work I'm doing with shared libraries underVMS
NOT BUG:It's not just VMS that needs some symbols to be hacked  Let'scentralise those hacks in crypto/symhacksh and use it everywhere it'sneeded
NOT BUG:Another thing I'm working on
NOT BUG:clarification source/sink BIOs are usually both source and sink
NOT BUG:Change the printing mahine used by BIO_printf and friends so it canhandle an externally provided "static" buffer as well a a dynamicbuffer  The "static" buffer is filled first, but if overflowed, thedynamic buffer is used instead, being allocated somewhere i the heapThis combines the benefits of putting the output in a preallocatedbuffer on the stack, for example and in a buffer that growssomewhere in the heap
NOT BUG:Some BIO docs, incomplete, more to followHmmm I didn't realise BIO_pop did that:isn't source wonderful?
BUG:Use name whateversolaris2 instead of sunsolaris2the middle string describes the architecture
NOT BUG:Get rid of ASN1_UTCTIME_get, which cannot work with time_treturn type on platforms where time_t is a 32 bit valueNew function ASN1_UTCTIME_cmp_time_t as a replacementfor use in apps/x509c
NOT BUG:See RSA Security's press release athttp://wwwrsasecuritycom/news/pr/0009061html September 6, 2000:"RSA Security Releases RSA Encryption Algorithm into Public Domain"
NOT BUG:Another superfluous pair of parentheses
NOT BUG:Another round of indentation changes: Position braces consistently,add some whitespace for 'if ', 'for ', 'while ' to distinguishkeywords from function names, and finally remove parens around returnvalues why be stingy with whitespace but fill the source codewith an abundance of parentheses that are not needed to structureexpressions for readability?
NOT BUG:More indentation consistency: for , while , if , return usually get a space between keyword and opening paranthesisso that they don't look like function calls, where no space isused
NOT BUG:Fix X509_STORE_CTX_init  Make indentation more consistent  Dump core less often
NOT BUG:'make update'
NOT BUG:Changes for QNX: there is no thread support, and the previousconfiguration only worked with noasm

NOT BUG:Handle WANT_READ more correctly thanks to Bodo
NOT BUG:BIG verify code reorganisationThe old code was painfully primitive and couldn't handledistinct certificates using the same subject nameThe new code performs several tests on a candidate issuercertificate based on certificate extensionsIt also adds several callbacks to X509_VERIFY_CTX so itsbehaviour can be customisedUnfortunately some hackery was needed to persuade X509_STOREto tolerate this This should go away when X509_STORE isreplaced, sometimeThis must have broken something though :
BUG:Distinguish between assertions and conditions that should cause death
NOT BUG:Keep a not of original encoding in certificate requestsAdd new option to PKCS7_sign to exclude S/MIME capabilities
NOT BUG:Mention fix in bio_libc
NOT BUG:Increase print buffer 10K instead of just 2K
NOT BUG:Ignore Makefilesave
NOT BUG:Remove silly test for b>references at the end of BIO_write:If some other thread deletes the BIO that one thread needs forBIO_write, then there's a lot of trouble anyway; there'snothing special about calling the callback
NOT BUG:Consistency
NOT BUG:Use consistent indentation,
NOT BUG:Avoid abort throughout the library, except when preprocessorsymbols for debugging are defined
NOT BUG:Fix for BN_mul_worda, 0
NOT BUG:Wall insists that main return an int
BUG:Include MD4 in documentation
NOT BUG:Tell CVS to ignore 'lib'
NOT BUG:Add 'rsautl' low level RSA utilityAdd DER public key routinesAdd passin argument to 'ca' utilityDocument sign and verify options to dgst
NOT BUG:Undo change from 17 to 18:Returning 1 for an attempt to read from an empty buffer is empty isnot an error that should be signalled via the error queue, it's a'retry read' condition and is signalled as such
BUG:Use C syntax, not FORTRAN or whatever that was :
BUG:QNX 4 support
BUG:N option to diff is not essential, and mentioning it is unnecessarilyconfusing to people whose diff doesn't implement it
NOT BUG:Add demo state machine
NOT BUG:Fix typo in i2d_ASN1_ENUMERATEDFix bug in read only memory BIOs so BIO_reset worksAdd sign and verify options to dgst utility, needto update docs

NOT BUG:Added OIDs from RFC 2247, 1155, and a few from 1700
NOT BUG:Assar wanted an address change
NOT BUG:Added BIO_vprintf and BIO_vsnprintf  The former because I'vefound myself needing it a number of times, the latter for completeness
NOT BUG:NULL is not an integer
NOT BUG:Document the added diversity to the possible log levels
NOT BUG:Add more diversity to the possible log levels  Now we have fullcoverage for all syslog level
NOT BUG:Added md4 to the VMS compilation
NOT BUG:make update
NOT BUG:New option 'ctestall' for mkdefpl, that makes it not only generateexisting functions, but really all functions that exist in libeaynumand ssleaynum  This is a good check on how much we should actuallyclean up the number files
NOT BUG:Document the reconfiguratoin option for Configure
NOT BUG:Allow reconfiguration  This can be useful if some source updaterequires that you configure again, but you don't want to reenter allthose configuration arguments again
NOT BUG:Correct the title  This also fooled the automatic documentation builderthat this was actually the pkcs7 document
BUG:IBMcxx complains that maxmem is as low as 2048 for certain moduleslike all the digests  Setting maxmem to 16K seems to give thecompiler enough space to do all the optimization it wants
NOT BUG:I forgot this file that Assar provided as well
NOT BUG:MD4 implemented  Assar Westerlund provided the digest code itself and the test utility, I added the bits to get a EVP interface, the command line utility and the speed test
NOT BUG:Memory leaks fix  It now looks like all memory leaks, at least aroundbuilding complete chains, are gone
NOT BUG:Memory leaks fix  There seems to be more in other parts of OpenSSL
NOT BUG:The pkcs12 had no way of getting a CA file or path to be used whenbuilding a complete chain  Now added through the CAfile and CApatharguments
NOT BUG:Abdelilah Essiari <aes@georgelblgov> reports that for very smallrecords, EVP_EncodeUpdate may misbehave  This happens when there'sa record boundary between the two ending b64 equal signs, which makesEVP_EncodeUpdate think there has been more than one EOF, and thereforeadd an extra NUL at the end of the output buffer  This fix correctsthat problem
NOT BUG:Duplicate names detected
NOT BUG:Make sure that 'initialized' is zeroed as well when cleaning up
NOT BUG:Fix for bad sorting of object namesAdd warning print out if duplicate names found:should end up as a fatal error but a warning fornow until they problems are fixed
BUG:For n > 7, we might get uninitialized unzeroed dataSpotted by "Kyoungho Jeon" <khjeon@securesoftcokr>
BUG:Changes needed for Tandem NSK, supplied by Scott Uroff scott@xyprocomFix warnings with BIO_dump_indent
NOT BUG:On Unicos, shorts are 8 bytes, so instead, use a structure with 2 32bit ints, just as in destestc
NOT BUG:On Unicos, openlog isn't constified, so let's not do that in xopenlog
NOT BUG:Unicos doesn't have sys/timebh  Fix it by defining the TIMEB macro unless on Unicos
NOT BUG:mumble unicos 10003 with Cray Standard C Version 6200 has a sysloghwhere the openlog is declared like this:extern int openlog __char _Ident, int _Logopt, int _Facility;
NOT BUG:Include SKIP DH parameters with OpenSSLThese have been created by a SHA1 based procedure, seehttp://wwwskipvpnorg/spec/numbershtmlThese values are taken from that document, I have notimplemented the prime generator
NOT BUG:Added and corrected documentation for the 'shared' option
NOT BUG:We've now covered the shared library support for Solaris, so the shared hackin config is no longer needed
NOT BUG:It's probably a good idea to make the shared libraries depend in EX_LIBS
NOT BUG:"make update"
NOT BUG:I had completely forgotten that print_table_entry also needed to read the two"shared" variables on it's own
NOT BUG:Add support for shared libraries on Solaris
NOT BUG:A few corrections with the shared library support:1 make sure libsslso becomes dependent on libcryptoso2 correct a number of silly bugs in the solarisshared target, and makesure libso also depends on libcso
NOT BUG:Make it so we can dynamically enable memory allocation debugging through theenvironment variable OPENSSL_DEBUG_MEMORY existence is sufficient  At thesame time, it makes sure that CRYPTO_malloc_debug_init gets expanded somewhere and thereby tested for compilation
NOT BUG:Remove casts that are no longer needed
NOT BUG:If a ip address is successfully parsed, the WSA structure under Win32 wasn'tproperly initialised  FixedBug reported by DeJuan Jackson <djackson@invergecom>
NOT BUG:Update 'openssl passwd' documentation on selection of algorithms
NOT BUG:Document the new DN printing optionsChange a few names to be more meaningfulFix typos in CApl docs
BUG:Document rollback issues
NOT BUG:Fix SSL 20 rollback checking: The previous implementation of thetest was never triggered due to an offbyone errorIn s23_clntc, don't use special rollbackattack detection paddingRSA_SSLV23_PADDING if SSL 20 is the only protocol enabled in theclient; similarly, in s23_srvrc, don't do the rollback check ifSSL 20 is the only protocol enabled in the server
NOT BUG:New ASN1_STRING_print_ex and X509_NAME_print_exfunctions These are intended to be replacementsfor the ancient ASN1_STRING_print and X509_NAME_printfunctionsThe new functions support RFC2253 and various prettyprinting options It is also possible to displayinternational characters if the terminal properly handlesUTF8 encoding Linux seems to tolerate this if the"unicode_start" script is runStill needs to be documented, integrated into otherutilities and extensively tested
NOT BUG:There's a slight possibility that a is 0 in BN_sub_word, and mighttherefore have unallocated parts  Therefore, a check for the 0 caseis needed, resulting with the same thing as when a is negative
BUG:In the case where a < 0 and |a| < w, the result assigned to a fromBN_add_word becomes wrongly negativeThis was discovered by Darrel Hankerson <dhankers@cacrmathuwaterlooca>
NOT BUG:Looks like Win32 builds do not define THREADS  However, they're stillsupporting threads, which means that th assertion is supperblydangerous, so make sure it's not compiled under Win32, period
NOT BUG:Add the possibility to get hexdumps of unprintable data when using'openssl asn1parse'  As a side effect, the functions ASN1_parse_dumpand BIO_dump_indent are added
NOT BUG:Fix a bug in the new i2d_{ENUMERATED,INTEGER} thatdidn't recognise NULL to mean 'don't output anything'
NOT BUG:When data are written out in very small blocks less than 3 bytes insize through the base64 filter, b64_write messes up it's parametersin such a way that instead of writing correct base64 output, the first4 characters of that output is repeated over and over  This fixcorrects that problem
NOT BUG:There's a deadlock when ssleay_rand_bytes is called the first time, sinceit wants to stir the pool using ssleay_rand_add  This fix provides thepossibility to call ssleay_rand_add inside a locked state by simply tellingit not to do any locking through a static variable  This isn't the mostelegant way one could do this, but it does retain thread safety during thestirring process
NOT BUG:Fix warningsIn crypto/err/errc need to initialise p toNULL in case thread_hash is NULL Otherwisep will be uninitialized
NOT BUG:Make NEG_PUBKEY_BUG on by defaultASN1_TIME fixesNew function c2i_ASN1_OBJECT
BUG:Darrel Hankerson <dhankers@cacrmathuwaterlooca> correctly discoveredthat of the result pointer to bn_mul was the same as one of the two arguments,That argument might have it's sign destroyed  He provided this fix
NOT BUG:Avoid a race condition if another thread happens to remove the errorstate at the same time

NOT BUG:Redo and enhance the support for building shared libraries  Currentlythere's support for building under Linux and True64 using examplesfrom the programming manuals, including versioning that is currentlythe same as OpenSSL versions but should really be a different seriesWith this change, it's up to the users to decide if they want sharedlibraries as well as the static ones  This decision now has to bedone at configuration time well, not really, those who know what theydo can still do it the same way as beforeThe OpenSSL programs openssl and the test programs are currentlyalways linked statically, but this may change in the future in aconfigurable manner  The necessary makefile variables to enable thisare in placeAlso note that I have done absolutely nothing about the Windows targetto get something similar  On the other hand, DLLs are already thedefault there, but without versioning, and I've no idea what thepossibilities for such a thing are there

NOT BUG:I got sick and tired of having to keep track of NIDs when such a thingcould be done automagically, much like the numbering in libeaynum andssleaynum  The solution works as follows: New object identifiers are inserted in objectstxt, following thesyntax given in objectsREADME objectspl is used to process obj_macnum and create a newobj_mach obj_datpl is used to create a new obj_dath, using the data inobj_machThis is currently kind of a hack, and the perl code in objectsplisn't very elegant, but it works as I intended  The simplest way tocheck that it worked correctly is to look in obj_dath and check thearray nid_objs and make sure the objects haven't moved around this isimportant!

NOT BUG:Actually comment out the parts of BN_MOD_MUL_WORD that I inteded tocomment out in the previous commit
NOT BUG:In BN_mod_exp_mont_word, avoid one application of BN_MOD_MUL_WORD,and for small 'a' also a couple of calls toBN_mod_mul_montgomeryr, r, r, 
NOT BUG:Move add_oid_section to appsc, so it can be shared by severalapplications  Also, have it and the certificate and key loadingfunctions take a BIO argument for error output
NOT BUG:Document the change in req
NOT BUG:Change req so the new parameter 'rand file' uses the given file inaddition to the file given through the RANDFILE option or environmentvariable
NOT BUG:On caseinsensitive systems, the 'install' target gets matched againstthe 'INSTALL' file, which means that 9 times of 10, the BlowFishheaders won't get installed  Avoid this in the same way it's done incrypto/des/Makefilessl, where someone apparently has thought of this
NOT BUG:Move the certificate and key loading functions to appsc, so they canbe shared by several applications
NOT BUG:Forgot the selfdocumentation within req
NOT BUG:Document the change in req
NOT BUG:Small change to accept the command line parameter 'rand file'  Thisparameter takes precedence over the RANDFILE option in theconfiguration file
NOT BUG:Change mkstackpl so it now sorts each groupinto lexical order Previously it depended onthe order of files in the directoryThis should now mean that all systems willagree on the order of safestackh and willnot change it needlessly and avoid massiveneedless commits to safestackh in futureIt wont however avoid this one :
NOT BUG:use faster version
NOT BUG: This adds some checking to the 'dlfcn' DSO_METHOD that at least letsit cope with OpenBSD which doesn't understand "RTLD_NOW" Added the dso_scheme config string entry for OpenBSDx86 to give itDSO support 'make update' that has also absorbed some of Steve's mkstack changesfor the ASNrelated macros
NOT BUG:Fixes for Win32 buildThis is mostly a work around for the old VC++ problemthat it treats func as funcvoidVarious prototypes had been added to 'compare' functionpointers that triggered this This could be fixed by removingthe prototype, adding function pointer casts to every call orchanging the passed function to use the expected argumentsI mostly did the latterThe mkdefpl script was modified to remove the typesafefunctions which no longer existOh and some functions called OPENSSL_freeLibrary werechanged back to FreeLibrary, wonder how that happened :
NOT BUG:Handle ASN1_SET_OF and PKCS12_STACK_OF using functioncasts in the same way as STACK_OF
NOT BUG:'make update'
NOT BUG:Avoid unnecessary links and incomplete program file in apps/
NOT BUG:'make update'
NOT BUG:Add the missing callback pointer handling functionsAlso, make sure empty slots of the dynamic lock stack are usedActually, I'm not really sure this is the right thing to do, and mayremove it, with an endlessly growing stack as result
NOT BUG:The dynamic thread API changed, and so does the documentation
NOT BUG:Add OPENSSL_free at the end of CRYPTO_destroy_dynlockid
NOT BUG:Redo the support for dynamic locks  First of all, it was terriblyinsecure, so a static lock is added to isolate the sensitive partsAlso, to avoid one thread freeing a lock that is used by another, areference counter is added
NOT BUG:With the new stack hack macros, there's no need to shorten the namesany more
NOT BUG:Modifications for VMS
NOT BUG:Add support for dynamically created and destroyed mutexes  This willbe needed in some ENGINE code, and might serve elsewhere as wellNote that it's implemented in such a way that the locking itself isdone through the same CRYPTO_lock function as the static locksWARNING: This is currently experimental and untested code it will gettested soon, though :
NOT BUG:First of all, with the current macros, we should never get anytypespecific stack function  Second, even when we don't build any ofthose functions, DECLARE_STACK_OF lines should not find themselvesinto $def
NOT BUG:Using speaking "variable" names in macros so that eg grepping forsk_whatever_insert and sk_whatever_set immediately reveals the subtledifference in parameter orderChange mkstackpl so that safestackh is not rewritten whennothing has changed
NOT BUG:Safe stack reorganisation in terms of function castsAfter some messing around this seems to work but needsa few more tests Working out the syntax for sk_set_cmp_funccast it to a function that itself returns a function pointerwas painful :Needs some testing to see what other compilers think of thissyntaxAlso needs similar stuff for ASN1_SET_OF etc etc

NOT BUG:typo
NOT BUG:In EVP_BytesToKey, replace explicit "8" by "PKCS5_SALT_LEN"
NOT BUG:There are compilers that complain if a variable has the same name as alabel Reported by Alexei Bakharevski
NOT BUG:Currently the DSO_METHOD interface has one entry point to bind all"symbols" including functions of all prototypes and variables Whilstcasting any function type to another violates ANSI C I believe, it isa necessary evil in sharedlibrary APIs However, it is quiteconceivable that functions in general and data symbols could very wellbe represented differently to each other on some systems, as Bodo said;> Since the function/object distinction is a lot more likely to be> important on reallife platforms supporting DSO and it can be quite> easily done and it will silence compilers that don't like> assignments from void pointers to function pointer variables, why> not do it?I agree So this change splits the "dso_bind" handler in DSO_METHODinto "dso_bind_var" and "dso_bind_func" Similarly the exportedfunction DSO_bind has been split in two I've also put togetherchanges for the various DSO_METHOD implementations, but so far onlyDSO_dlfcn has been tested BTW: The prototype for dso_bind had beena bit strange so I've taken the opportunity to change its shape inboth variationsAlso, the README has been updated  particularly with a note aboutusing customised native nametranslation for shared libraries and thatyou can't do it yet

NOT BUG:Comment about bcopy on SunOS 4x
NOT BUG:Using checks of the existence of HEADER_{foo}_H in other header fileswas a really bad idea  For example, the following:include <x509h>include <bioh>include <asn1h>would make sure that things like ASN1_UTCTIME_print wasn't definedunless you moved the inclusion of bioh to above the inclusion ofx509h  The reason is that x509h includes asn1h, and thedeclaration of ASN1_UTCTIME_print depended on the definition ofHEADER_BIO_H  That's what I call an obscure bugInstead, this change makes sure that whatever header files are neededfor the correct process of one header file are included automagically,and that the definitions of, for example, BIOrelated things aredependent on the absence of the NO_{foo} macros  This is alsoconsistent with the way parts of OpenSSL can be excluded at will

NOT BUG:"make update" + stripping the typespecific stack functions out oflibeaynum and ssleaynum
NOT BUG:This change will cause builds by default to not use different STACKstructures and functions for each stack type The previous behaviourcan be enabled by configuring with the "DDEBUG_SAFESTACK" optionThis will also cause "make update" mkdefpl in particular toupdate the libeaynum and ssleaynum symbol tables with the number ofextra functions DEBUG_SAFESTACK createsThe way this change works is to accompany each DECLARE_STACK_OFmacro with a set of "define"d versions of the sk_type_functions that ensures all the existing "typesafe" stack calls areprecompiled into the underlying stack calls The presence or abscenceof the DEBUG_SAFESTACK symbol controls whether this block of"define"s or the DECLARE_STACK_OF macro is taking effect Theblock of "define"s is in turn generated and maintained by a perlscript util/mkstackpl that encompasses the block with delimitingC comments This works in a similar way to the autogenerated errorcodes and, like the other such maintenance utilities, is invokedby the "make update" targetA long but mundane commit will follow this with the results of"make update"  this will include all the "define" blocks foreach DECLARE_STACK_OF statement, along with stripped downlibeaynum and ssleaynum files
NOT BUG:The previous commit to crypto/stack/[ch] pulled the typesafety stringsyet tighter, and also put some heat on the rest of the library byinsisting correctly that compare callbacks used in stacks are prototypedwith "const" parameters This has led to a depthfirst explosion ofcompiler warnings in the code where 1 constification has led to 3 or 4more Fortunately these have all been resolved to completion and the codeseems cleaner as a result  in particular many of the _cmp functionsshould have been prototyped with "const"s, and now are There was onelittle problem however;X509_cmp should by rights compare "const X509 " pointers, and it is nowdeclared as such However, it's internal workings can involverecalculating hash values and extensions if they have not already beensetup Someone with a more intricate understanding of the flow control ofX509 might be able to tighten this up, but for now  this seemed theobvious place to stop the "depthfirst" constification of the code byusing an evil cast they have migrated all the way here from safestackhFortunately, this is the only place in the code where this was requiredto complete these typesafety changes, and it's reasonably clear andcommented, and seemed the least unacceptable of the options Trying totake the constification further ends up exploding out considerably, andindeed leads directly into generalised ASN functions which are not likelyto cooperate well with this
NOT BUG:This is the first of two commits didn't want to dump them all into thesame one However, the first will temporarily break things until thesecond comes through :The safestackh handling was mapping compare callbacks that externallyare of the type int type ,type  into the underlying callbacktype used by stack[ch], which is int void ,void  After somedegree of digging, it appears that the callback type in the underlyingstack code should use double pointers too  when the compare operationsare invoked from sk_find and sk_sort, they are being used by bsearchand qsort to compare two pointers to pointers This change corrects theprototyping by only casting to the void,void form at the momentit is needed by bsearch and qsort and makes the mapping in safestackhmore transparent It also changes from "void" to "char" to stay inkeeping with stack[ch]'s assumed base type of "char"Also  the "const" situation was that safestackh was throwing away"const"s, and to compound the problem  a close examination of stackcshowed that const char  is not really achieving what it is supposedto when the callback is being invoked, what is needed isconst char  const  So the underlying stack[ch] and the mappingmacros in safestackh have all been altered to correct thisWhat will follow are the vast quantities of "const" corrections requiredin stackdependant code that was being let "slip" through whensafestackh was discarding "const"s These now all come up as compilerwarnings

NOT BUG:The handling of DSA_METHOD and DH_METHOD wasn't quite as problematic aswith RSA_METHOD the _get_default_methods do set the default value ifit's not set However, the code had some duplication and was a bitconterintuitive
NOT BUG:Previously, the default RSA_METHOD was NULL until the first RSA structure wasinitialised, at which point an appropriate default was chosen This meant acall to RSA_get_default_method might have returned FALSEThis change fixes that; now any called to RSA_new, RSA_new_methodNULL, orRSA_get_default_method will ensure that a default is chosen if it wasn'talready

NOT BUG:This commit ties the new DSO code crypto/dso/ into the build for avariety of platforms A few are missing, and they will be added ineventually, but as this is new stuff, it was better to not break lots ofplatforms in one go that we can't easily test The changes to "Configure"should illustrate how to add support to other systems if you feel likehaving a goNB: I'll add something shortly to allow you to add "dlfcnh" support onthose platforms that don't have or need a dlfcnh header file Thesymbol for Configure will probably by "dlfcn_no_h"Thanks to Richard Levitte, who is responsible for the dso_dlc support,understanding the trickier aspects of the build process, and giving greatfeedback on everything else[Don't use this stuff if you're easily offended by changes to theinterface or behaviour  it's still work in progress]PR:
NOT BUG:This is a set of startup code for the DSO support, it's not yet linked intothe build process an upcoming commit no doubt, and is very much newcode  what that means is that it compiles ok  usually It certainlydoesn't mean it runs well or even properly yet Please don't muck roundwith this unless you're looking to help out and hunt bugs :Currently this code doesn't have any support for controlling the "load"behaviour eg paths, filename translations, etc That'll be handledusing DSO_ctrl and various flags, once we work out a sensible set offlags

NOT BUG: Added more documentation in CHANGES Made CRYPTO_MDEBUG even less used in cryptoh, givingMemCheck_start and MemCheck_stop only one possible definition Made the values of the debug function pointers in memc dependenton the existence of the CRYPTO_MDEBUG macro, and made the rest ofthe code understand the NULL caseThat's it  With this code, the old behvior of the debug functionalityis restored, but you can still opt to have it on, even when thelibrary wasn't compiled with a defined CRYPTO_MDEBUG
NOT BUG: Made sure some changed behavior is documented in CHANGES Moved the handling of compiletime defaults from cryptoh tomem_dbgc, since it doesn't make sense for the library users to tryto affect this without recompiling libcrypto Made sure V_CRYPTO_MDEBUG_TIME and V_CRYPTO_MDEBUG_THREAD had clearand constant definitions Aesthetic correction

NOT BUG:Clear out license confusion
NOT BUG:Rebuild of the OpenSSL memory allocation and deallocation routinesWith this change, the following is provided and present at all timesmeaning CRYPTO_MDEBUG is no longer required to get this functionality: hooks to provide your own allocation and deallocation routinesThey have to have the same interface as malloc, realloc andfree  They are registered by calling CRYPTO_set_mem_functionswith the function pointers hooks to provide your own memory debugging routines  The have tohave the same interface as as the CRYPTO_dbg_ routines  Theyare registered by calling CRYPTO_set_mem_debug_functions withthe function pointersI moved everything that was already built into OpenSSL and did memorydebugging to a separate file mem_dbgc, to make it clear what iswhatWith this, the relevance of the CRYPTO_MDEBUG has changed  The onlything in crypto/cryptoh that it affects is the definition of theMemCheck_start and MemCheck_stop macros

NOT BUG:Two changes have been made:1 Added code to the memory leak detecting code to give the user thepossibility to add information, thereby forming a traceback2 Make the memory leak detecting code multithreadsafeThe idea is that we're actually dealing with two separate criticalsections, one containing the hash tables with the information, theother containing the current memory checking mode  Those should notbe handled with the same lock, especially since their handling overlapHence, the added second lock
NOT BUG:Some crypto applications are now being built on Unix, so they should on VMS as well  Not by default, however
NOT BUG:It's possible that considering the configuration file as a binary fileworks on Unix and MSDOS/Windows  It does not under VMS, so open itas text

NOT BUG:Always hash the pid in the first iteration in ssleay_rand_bytes,don't try to detect forks by looking at getpidThe reason is that threads sharing the same memory can have differentPIDs; it's inefficient to run RAND_seed each time a different threadcalls RAND_bytes

NOT BUG:Oops forgot the other RSA_NULL patches
NOT BUG:This is preliminary support for an "RSA null" cipher Unfortunately whenOpenSSL is compiled with NO_RSA, no RSA operations can be used: includingkey generation storage and display of RSA keys Since these operations arenot covered by the RSA patent my understanding is it only covers encrypt,decrypt, sign and verify they can be included: this is an often requestedfeature, attempts to use the patented operations return an error codeThis is enabled by setting RSA_NULL This means that if a particular applicationhas its own legal US RSA implementation then it can use that instead by settingit as the default RSA methodStill experimental and needs some fiddling of the other libraries so they havesome options that don't attempt to use RSA if it isn't allowed

NOT BUG:SHA cleanup and LP64 tuneup"Cleanup" stands for the fact that it's using common message digesttemplate /md32_commonh and sha[1_]dgstc are reduced down to'define SHA_[01]' and then 'include "sha_loclh"' It stands "LP64"there because it's 64 bit platforms which benefit most from the tuneupThe updated code exhibits 40 performance improvement on IRIX64sounds too good, huh?

NOT BUG:Remove traces of bad idea :
NOT BUG:Older versions of SINIX C development system inherited a bug fromSGI' cc; enable workaroundSubmitted by: Martin Kraemer
NOT BUG:It was a very bad idea to use include "/e_osh"  when this occursin cryptlibh which is often included as "/cryptlibh", then thequestion remains relative to which directory this is to be interpretedgcc went one further directory up, as intended; but makedepend thinksdifferently, and so probably do some C compilers  So the / must go away;thus e_osh goes back into include/openssl but I now useinclude "openssl/e_osh" instead of <openssl/e_osh> to make the point and we have another huge bunch of dependency changes  Argh
NOT BUG:Don't include toplevel CVS directory
NOT BUG:The last argument in the d2i_XXX_fp and  d2i_XXX_bio functions should beof type XXX  not XXX 
NOT BUG:Add a kludge :There were problems with putting e_osh just into the top directory,because the test programs are compiled within test/ in the "standard"case in in their original directories in the makefileone case;and in the latter symlinks may not be available

NOT BUG:Typo
NOT BUG:DES changes
NOT BUG:Change type of various DES function arguments from des_cblockmeaning pointer to char to des_cblock  meaning pointer toarray with 8 char elements, which allows the compiler todo more typechecking  The changed argument types were of typedes_cblock  back in SSLeay, and a lot of ugly casts wereused then to turn them into pointers to elements; but it can bedone without those castsIntroduce new type const_des_cblock  before, the pointers ratherthan the elements pointed to were declared const, and forsome reason gcc did not complain about this but some othercompilers did

NOT BUG:Add a useful kludge to allow package maintainers to specify compiler and otherplatforms details on the command line without having to patch the Configurescript everytime: One now can use ``perl Configure <id>:<details>'', ieplatform ids are allowed to have details appended to them seperated bycolons This is treated as there would be a static preconfigured entry inConfigure's table under key <id> with value <details> and ``perl Configure<id>'' is called  So, when you want to perform a quick testcompile underFreeBSD 31 with pgcc and without assembler stuff you can use ``perl Configure"FreeBSDelf:pgcc:O6:::"'' now, which overrides the FreeBSDelf entryontheflyPS: Notice that the same effect _cannot_ be achieved by using``make CCpgcc '' etc, because you cannot override allthings from there

NOT BUG:Remember one more wish from the users
NOT BUG:Add a bunch of SSL_xxx functions for configuring the temporary RSA and DHprivate keys and/or callback functions which directly correspond to theirSSL_CTX_xxx counterparts but work on a perconnection basis This is neededfor applications which have to configure certificates on a perconnectionbasis eg Apache+mod_ssl instead of a percontext basis egs_serverFor the RSA certificate situation is makes no difference, but for the DSAcertificate situation this fixes the "no shared cipher" problem where theOpenSSL cipher selection procedure failed because the temporary keys were notovertaken from the context and the API provided no way to reconfigure themThe new functions now let applications reconfigure the stuff and they are indetail: SSL_need_tmp_RSA, SSL_set_tmp_rsa, SSL_set_tmp_dh,SSL_set_tmp_rsa_callback and SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback  Additionally a newnonpublicAPI function ssl_cert_instantiate is used as a helper functionand also to reduce code redundancy inside ssl_rsacSubmitted by: Ralf S EngelschallReviewed by: Ben Laurie

BUG:Remember the cleanup
NOT BUG:First cut for a very conservative source tree cleanup:1 merge various obsolete readme texts into doc/ssleaytxtwhere we collect the old documents and readme texts2 remove the first part of files where I'm already sure that we no longer needthem because of three reasons: either they are just temporary files whichwere left by Eric or they are preserved original files where I've verifiedthat the diff is also available in the CVS via "cvs diff rSSLeay_0_8_1b"or they were renamed as it was definitely the case for the crypto/md/stuffWe've still a horrible mess under crypto/bn/asm/  There for a lot of filesI'm sure whether we need them or not So, when someone knows it better, feelfree to cleanup there

NOT BUG:Time to blow up the source tree : This is the beginning of support forGeneralizedTime At several points PKIX specifies that GeneralizedTime can beused but OpenSSL doesn't currently support it This patch adds several filesand a bunch of functionsOf interest is the ASN1_TIME structure and its related functions At severalpoints certificates, CRLs et al specify that a time can be expressed as achoice of UTCTime and GeneralizedTime Currently OpenSSL interprets thiswrongly as UTCTime because GeneralizedTime isn't supported The ASN1_TIMEstuff provides this functionalityStill todo is to trace which cert and CRL points need an ASN1_TIME and modifythe utilities appropriately and of course fix all the bugsNote new OpenSSL copyright in the new file a_timec I didn't put it ina_gentmc because it is a minimally modified form a_utctmc Since this adds new files and error codes you will need to do a 'make errors'at the top level to add the new codes

NOT BUG:Fix version stuff:1 The already released version was 091c and not 091b2 The next release should be 092 and not 091d, becausefirst the changes are already too large, second we should avoid any more091x confusions and third, the Apache version semantics ofVERSIONREVISIONPATCHLEVEL for the version string is reasonable and here2 is already just a patchlevel and not major changetVS:
